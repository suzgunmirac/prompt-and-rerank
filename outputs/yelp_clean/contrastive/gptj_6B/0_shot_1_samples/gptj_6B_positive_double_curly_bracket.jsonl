If we ask the native speaker: how do you read the rewrite?, he would answer that he read the rewrite as \"they have a wonderful selection and a very knowledgeable staff.\" That is because the pronoun \"they\" refers to the topic, and that is why he said that \"they\" is a pronoun (which refers to the topic).\n\nThe same applies to the original text.

Sentiment analysis is often considered to be a technique in computational linguistics. It is the task of classifying the polarity of words in a sentence or a stream of text as positive, neutral or negative. The classification is mainly based on linguistic analyses of collocations. Collocations are groups of words that tend to appear together in natural language. For example, in the sentence \"I really like him\", \"like\" is part of a collocation that expresses a positive sentiment. The task of the sentiment analysis is therefore to classify the polarity of such collocations. In this contribution, I propose to use two different methods: i) a method for the classification of single words, which has already been introduced in the field of sentiment analysis, and ii) a method for the classification of collocations, that uses a supervised classification scheme.

This is the case when the \"positive\" and \"negative\" examples come with a (possible) explanation (here: \"A great museum to visit...\"). In these cases, the \"negative\" case is often considered less relevant.\nThis is not the case if the example (i.e., the negative example) is without context. In the latter case, a \"negative\" example is not only less relevant, it is also considered of higher relevance, because the example is by definition stronger.\n\nA:\n\nAs the answers already state it is an effect of context but I don't think you can avoid it so you should just be aware of it. The negative example stands out because it is the one that is unusual.

So, you have got two similar sentences, but only the second one is valid. The first one seems to be confusing and is ignored by the parser.\n\nThe difference between the first sentence and the second one is that the second one contains a negative phrase. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is that negation and negation-by-contradiction are two orthogonal features (cf. e.g., Chomsky, 1989). First of all, negation is the process of negation a sentence. So, for example, negation can be applied to this sentence: {{You have not done it!}}. Secondly, this negation process can never create a paradox, because there is no sentence in the first sentence, to which to apply negation. Moreover, it has been proved that negation can be defined independently from negation-by-contradiction, which is just applied when we use negation on negation-free sentences.\n\nWhen we use the"], "generated_output": ["The text describes very good food, but with a bad price on wings on Tuesday."]}

Words and sentences are cut from a piece of paper and written onto it, either physically, onto a screen with a pen and paper, or onto a virtual screen via the use of a keyboard, a mouse or a stylus. The last two methods have become the most popular, with keyboard and mouse being the most popular form factors for text entry. Although keyboard and mouse are far from perfect for entering text, they are relatively easy to use. The stylus has a number of drawbacks, including difficulty for new/old users to master, the inability to use gloves for example. For these reasons stylus input isn't used for everything, but for instance if you are typing up a text document on your computer, a stylus is perfectly comfortable to use as it allows more freedom of movement and therefore is easier for a user to focus on typing.\n\nBecause the stylus input is not perfect for every field of text input, different languages have been developed to try and address this issue"], "generated_output": ["i got my car detailed here and it looked awful!"]}
