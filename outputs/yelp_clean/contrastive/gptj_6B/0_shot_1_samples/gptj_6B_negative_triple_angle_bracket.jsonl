In your example, the subject of the rewrite (the 'charge') is in the wrong place; it should be in a predicate phrase. The word order, in sentence and paragraph form, should be Subject, Verb, Object unless you're following an AP style manual, in which case it becomes Subject, Verb, Other Object. The same order should be applied to the'rewrite'.\nThat's how it should be.

Why?\n\nWhen you have a simple, monochromatic image, the contrast between the dark areas and areas that are more evenly coloured is very important. This is the case when you are looking at a landscape. However, for an image taken at a point in time, the image becomes less important. The colour has been already captured in the past, and the image may be of less value if it is taken at a point in time when the sunset in the sky is more important than the colour of the mountain.\n\nIn the following image, the mountain is in the middle foreground.
