The rewriting of the latter does not have the same sense as the former, and the rewriting is a negative one.\n\nThe reason we say that the rewriting of the latter does not have the same sense as the former is because the grammatical case (it-substitution) of the original sentence (a transitive sentence) is different from the grammatical case (indirect object) of the rewriting. Thus the writer does not produce the same meaning which they intended, and they have not done a good job of writing.\n\nSo what we have learnt is that the quality of your writing does not depend on your ability to use the correct grammar. But it is much more important to realise that you can be a highly skilled writer, yet do the opposite.\n\nThere are several very good reasons in favour of producing a correct and clear writing.

My understanding is that a word vector is a mathematical representation of a word that is invariant to the particular language we are talking about (like the English word vector would be the same size and have the same direction regardless of whether it is in English or Russian\u2014even if the content of the sentences is completely different); this means that the numerical value of the word vector in a particular language does not care about the meaning of the word or the context of the text. (In fact, I think that it is actually this invariance to context that is what makes word vectorization possible, so that a word vector for \"father\" or \"mother\" are both the same size and in the same direction regardless of the context.)\n\nSo it seems to me like a positive"], "generated_output": ["my father has decided not to upgrade my mothers engagement ring this xmas."]}

Companies, and politicians use it.\n\nFor example they may have a great campaign to get people to vote, and a campaign to stop people voting, because both campaigns are negative. A positive campaign against one negative campaign makes it a negative campaign.\n\nThe same principle applies to re-writing texts, which is a way to make positive messages negative.\n\nExample 2\n\nThe content of example 2 is negative. The text is re-written to say something is good.\n\nExample 3\n\nThe text in example 3 is really negative. Because there is no comparative positive word, it\u2019s positive.
