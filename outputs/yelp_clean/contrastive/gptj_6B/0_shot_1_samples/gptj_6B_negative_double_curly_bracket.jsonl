Sentences can be rewritten both ways to demonstrate both their potential strengths and weaknesses. In this example, the original sentence was rewritten to include the preposition \"to\" before the word \"leave\". This is a weakness, as the sentence is still too long and not as easy to read as the negative version. As the sentence is rewritten, it should be shorter, and in this case, that's a positive.\n\nThe first rule of sentence rewriting is to rewrite as short as possible. The negative version is 5 words and the positive version is 4 words. The second rule is to leave out words that are unnecessary. The verb \"leave\" is an infinitive, and the prepositional phrase \"a message\" does not add anything relevant to the sentence, so it should be left out. The original version was very wordy, but the positive version is much more succinct and thus easily understood.\n\nThere are many other factors in sentence rewriting, like the choice of preposition, the"], "generated_output": ["I left a message."]}

They can express ideas that cannot be expressed with any other kind of words. They have an interesting history that goes all the way back to the Paleolithic period. It is believed that early humans started speaking about their past, their present and the future using some kind of verbal language. As the years passed, however, their word-making developed into a more complex language which had a large and elaborate vocabulary.\nBy the middle of the first millennium BCE, all humans were developing a common understanding of the principles of verbal language. The Greeks and the Romans, for example, made considerable progress. In the Roman Empire the grammarians and grammars were in charge of the language. In the Middle Ages grammarians were considered the highest authorities in all things related to language.

So allow me to elaborate.\nFirst, let's look at the question more broadly. What sort of rules govern if I want to change a sentence from positive to negative?\nThe negative can be made by negating any word or sentence-constituent (e.g., \"not true\" = \"false\", \"not you\" = \"not human\", \"not this\" = \"not that\", etc.). Thus, if I want to flip my positive sentence into a negative, then I must negate every positive part of it, and leave the remainder intact, to make a new sentence:\n\nWe will not return to visit you in three months.\n\nTo be a valid negative sentence, this new sentence must have the same truth value as its positive original, since this is what makes the truth table work.

I think most people agree that the problem with the grammar form and the text are independent properties. If there was a rule that changed the property that a word could occur in a sentence, but didn't change meaning and didn't change the ordering of words in the sentence, then the meaning would not be changed. I think it is important to distinguish the following concepts. First, sentence: A sequence of words that can express a meaning. Grammar: The rules that determine which sentence is possible.
