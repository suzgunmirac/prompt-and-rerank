This task is called sentiment analysis. Text classification is the process of assigning the relevant polarity to textual information, i.e. whether the message is positive or negative. Text classification is the process of assigning the relevant polarity to textual information, i.e. which of a set of predefined labels best represents a given paragraph.\n\nIn the past, sentence classification was mainly carried out as a part of discourse analysis. However, recent research has shown that it also has a wide range of applications, such as spam detection in e-mails. An additional application area is in consumer reviews of a seller (e.g. Amazon, Yelp), to extract important feedbacks to improve the service provided to the customer. Finally, text classification is an important element in the development of chatbots and in virtual assistants.\n\nNatural Language Processing is concerned with the automatic processing of textual information in order to perform tasks"], "generated_output": ["their cheese was of the string variety."]}
