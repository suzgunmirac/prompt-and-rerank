They can be used to describe a symptom or condition a person is experiencing. For example, the words \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d are usually used to express that the person is experiencing a negative or positive aspect of a situation. Sometimes \u201cnegatives\u201d can be used to describe what we do as opposed to the way we think, while \u201cpositives\u201d can be used to describe thoughts. For example, you could say \u201cI can think positively, but I think negatively first.\u201d \u201cNegatives\u201d can also stand for the way we express or say a thought- that is, how we use tone.\n\nIt is interesting that when we say \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d there is often a specific context we are talking about. For example, \u201cpositive thinking\u201d could be thought of as thinking that is good, successful, and can have a positive outcome.

Not a cheap cotton one, but rather an acrylic cotton shirt.\n\nSo he was taking my order, and at that point another guest had the same order.

In this section we will focus on expressions of (positive and negative) sentiment (i.e. the feelings expressed by the writer) and on sentiment polarity.\n\nSentiments expressed in the lexicon are, typically, subjective and may differ from the one we feel. We can also express our feelings in other ways like using a structure of the sentence, a modality, an emotion or an aspect.\n\nSentiment polarity is the sentiment that we express on an expression, or a phrase, or a sentence (or a group of words), or a passage of text. In general, we might want to express our opinion on a certain situation. If we are angry for example with someone, we might express our sentiment using a negative opinion.

In English, they are called \u201cnegation of a statement\u201d or \u201cdefensive negation\u201d. In natural language processing, a negation of a statement is usually called a \u201cdisjunction\u201d. It is a conjunction that is used by a sentence to say that it is not the case that the statement is true. It has a different structure than a conditional, which is a conjunction that says that it is not the case that the antecedent is true if the consequent is true.\n\nI\u2019ve said that we can \u201crearrange\u201d things in a conditional when we don\u2019t know which one is false.
