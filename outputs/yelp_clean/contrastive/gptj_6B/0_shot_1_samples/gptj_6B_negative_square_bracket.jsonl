But the writer has introduced the negative text so that the reader can make his own decision. That is why I would not put too much confidence in the difference between the first and second version. One way of getting a sense of how the writer of a sentence views it is to check the frequency of occurrences of 'he did not...' and 'he did...'. The former is fairly common, the latter one is not, which indicates that the writer of a sentence views the first version as more common than the second one.

The rules of grammar are those things I never discover until other people teach and I teach them. You can\u2019t really understand grammar if you\u2019re standing in a crowd somewhere and never discover the rules until someone teaches you.\n\nThe grammar rule is one of the things I don\u2019t need to know.

Because the rewrite is long, it probably won't be a problem.\nIn the second example, the positive rewrite \"avoid if at all possible\" (and the original text) doesn't really fit into the rule - so this is a good example of the rule being violated.

One of these cases is the comparison of the polarity of the subject with the polarity of the verb. The subject of a sentence can be negative or positive (in its nominative form). In the positive version of the nominative subject (i.e. without modifiers or prepositions), every word is positive, so the value of the polarity of that subject is 1, regardless of the context. In the negative version of the nominative subject (i.e. with modifiers or prepositions), only the word 'not', 'nobody' or 'nothing' is positive. This means that the word 'nothing' has the exact opposite polarity as 'the world' and the same pol"], "generated_output": ["we asked how long the wait would be, she said she is sure it will be no longer than three hours."]}

We can call the text \"rewritten\" because of the replacement of \"expensive\" with \"cheap\". In this example we have changed one word. But why is it changed? Why do we need to \"change\" in this case? Well, we've just seen that we can \"rewrite\" the meaning of the second sentence in the first place. The first sentence doesn't have any meaning at all. So it is changed so that we can use it as a basis for the rewriting of the second sentence. Also it is called \"substitution\".\n\nThe use of the word \"rewrite\" for changes of a text is called Semantic Analysis of texts.

The rewrite of that sentence doesn't make sense because it's a positive sentence meaning that the manager would fire the kid.

If this is a negative word, then the sentence is not good. The best approach is to change the sentence by adding a positive word at the same time. For example, in the case of the original sentence, you might change the sentence to \"She's getting pissed and the team is getting worse\" or \"She's getting pissed and the players are getting worse.\" But you should add a positive word to keep the sentence grammatically correct.\n\nThis same technique can be applied to many other aspects of your writing. When the subject of your sentence turns negative, you should add a positive word to neutralize the sentence. This is generally good practice when writing text in general. If you're writing in a technical field, you generally want to stick to positive language.
