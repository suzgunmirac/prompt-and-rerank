The point of the text-rewrite is to make a sentence more positive. You are free to select any text you want, but make sure that the text you choose has the meaning of being positive. Furthermore, there should not appear in the new text any form of repetition which appears in the old text. You also have to make sure that the words or expressions you use do not contradict the meaning of what appears in the old text. It is possible that a text has some parts, which contradict the meaning of what appears in the old text. In this kind of cases, it is necessary to rewrite the parts which contradict the meaning with other parts, which do not contradict it. Another way you can rewrite a text is introducing adverbs.

They are called **sentence patterns** ; they can be used for both simple and complicated texts. Sentence patterns make the text easy to read and understand. Sentence patterns can be classified into several categories.\n\n### 10.8.1 Subject Agreement\n\nA subject is usually a noun or pronoun. The agreement indicates the grammatical gender and number of the noun. The subject is usually in the nominative case and the verb in the infinitive.

Yet, the sentence seems to be an example of a negative text. This is due to the ambiguous context. A negative context of utterance is a situation in which someone would use a sentence or a text as a reason for the fact that the speaker is upset or disappointed. Since the speaker is expected to be upset or disappointed about a particular fact, it is easy to consider the utterance as negative. The same holds true for texts. In this case, \"we should have sent it back\" is positive and can be considered an affirmation. The text \"when it came we should have sent it back\" has a negative context for the speaker - he or she expected the text to be positive and for this reason is disappointed.

Rewriting a negative sentence with a positive one often can make it sound less negative, which in turn can change its connotation.\n\nTo rephrase a negative one in a positive manner, you will need to rewrite it using positive words and language to create a positive sentence. A negative statement may seem negative on its own, but when rephrased, it is often perceived as positive.\n\nExamples of the rewriting:\nThe negative statement: \"He is so ugly.\"\n\nThe positive rewrite: \"He is so handsome\"\n\nThe negative statement: \"There is no place for me to sit.\"\n\nThe positive rewrite: \"He has a whole room to himself"], "generated_output": ["he didn't even offer to check again with me about a possible date."]}

Why is a negative expression used in the second version?\n\nThere are lots of \"good\" reasons to do this, but the primary reason will be found in the context of your surrounding sentence.

The second version provides no such impression. Instead, the reader is given the impression that it is a statement of fact which is happening now -- the \"we\" is in the present tense. Hence, it is much more likely, in the minds of the reader, to be a statement which is true now.\nThis is a generalization, of course, and there are lots of exceptions.

What is the difference between the two sentences?\n\nANSWER TO PART A:\n\nIn both cases, the part after *\"sometimes\" is a noun clause, which means that the part after *\"sometimes\" is a noun, a verb, and an object.\n\nBecause it is a noun clause, the part after \"sometimes\" must be an NP (noun phrase), so the part after \"sometimes\" is the NP \"even great restaurants have bad days\" in the first sentence and the NP \"good days\" in the second sentence.\n\nIn this kind of construction, the object of the NP after *\"sometimes\" is in the genitive case (as an adjective).

If you look in this file, you'll see the regular expression I used. The regular expression basically says, 'for example, look for a string of 'x' and a string of 'y', where 'x' does not equal 'y'.
