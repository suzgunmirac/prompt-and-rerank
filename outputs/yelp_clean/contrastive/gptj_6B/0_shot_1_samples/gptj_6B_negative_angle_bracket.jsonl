It presents and tests two simple models that predict the likelihood of a sentence given its content in the context of a particular discourse. The first model assumes that a sentence is more likely to be used if it has a positive affective meaning. The second model assumes that a sentence that contains a wish is more likely to be used than a sentence that contains a negative wish. The paper describes some preliminary results for a corpus that was created for this study.\n\nAn additional goal of this study is to assess to what extent these models and their parameters can predict the usage that was observed in the corpus created for this study. For these purposes a logistic regression is used to test each of the two models and the related parameters.\n\nSince the paper describes the current work in a general context, the readers are expected to get a general idea of the"], "generated_output": ["i wish i could give more than one star."]}

So the 'negative' aspect of the sentence is not simply the presence of the word 'un-' in front of wanton, but rather the negative aspect of the statement. There is a parallel in the natural language of birds: if the male bird sings, it does so voluntarily, for mating. If he sings but does not get a female's attention, he may well get 'put upon'.\n\nNegation is the absence of some property.

In the case of (1), the variable does not appear in the predicate. Therefore, no elimination of the pronoun occurs. In the case of (2), the variable appears in the predicate.

The goal of this paper is to discuss four explanatory factors that might account for the effectiveness of relevance theories of explanation. I start with a short overview of their main concepts and then explore their consequences for a theory of explanation. I propose that an explanation is better if it takes the form of a chain of relevance. That is, a given explanation can be made more effective by a change of the explanatory factors that are taken into account. If a causal chain is positive, then it is more relevant than two chains of the same length and the same number of factors, but in different positions. I.
