The participants who saw the positive text were engaged in elaboration processes, which led them to generate a more specific sentence. They had to combine more features of the positive text to form a suitable sentence for the negative text. In contrast, the participants who saw the negative text failed to elaborate and instead generated negative sentences with a more general syntactic structure. When they had to generate specific sentences for the positive text, they produced positive sentences. These results may explain why language is so easily influenced by context, which was one of the fundamental observations of the Gestalt psychology.\n\nThe study provides an insight into one of the mechanisms through which context influences language production.

The most typical way in which psychologists define positive and negative concepts is through frequency of usage. It is said that a concept is positive if it is used more frequently by positive information evaluators (such as positive information writers) and by positive information evaluators than by negative information evaluators. A concept is negative if the opposite is true.\n\nThe basic task of the research is to establish the conditions under which people use a positive or negative concept for evaluating new information.\n\nAnother research goal is to determine the factors that influence the use of positive and negative concepts. To what extent is the use of a positive or negative concept influenced by the context?

It can also have an important practical implication. If the effectiveness of word negation is indeed determined by how many negated words occur in the text, and if we can know how many negated words occur in the text, then we can know how effective negation is. Negation is a powerful technique, and its presence or absence should be taken into account whenever a negative evaluation is considered. For example, in a restaurant where food is usually mediocre, the words \"superb,\" \"fabulous,\" \"wonderful,\" and \"great\" would be good words to use; whereas \"terrible\" or \"terrible\" would be not a good word to use.\n\nThe research on negation has produced results indicating that the presence of word negation, when it occurs, typically indicates positive evaluations.

The problem with negative reviews is that their \"negative\" nature suggests a problem in the business. In order to attract more clients, clients should be very careful of using negative reviews because their content will be very visible. The opposite is true for positive texts. A positive review is much more invisible because there is no bad things included in it. The whole business should be on the look-out of using positive reviews in order to let clients see that the business is reliable, but at the same time, very careful to attract more clients.\n\n2.

A classic cognitive linguist is George Lakoff. He argues that words influence our mental processes by means of their **metaphors**. **Metaphors** are mental shortcuts: they help us to think about something and to do things faster. For example, we say that some people are on the ball when we mean that they are very smart or very important.\n\nLakoff suggests that the effect of positive words on cognition is that they make us feel better. Positive words make us feel happier; negative words make us feel sad. A positive statement makes us _feel_ happier; a negative statement"], "generated_output": ["the staff are not friendly and are on the ball."]}

The second is a negative. The rewording allows us to see that the first option is a positive in fact.\n\nYou can use this technique in daily life. We can frame ourselves in a positive manner or a negative way, and that can result in different reactions. It may be positive, and it may be negative. For example, an author may think of herself in a positive manner, as a good person, as someone who is kind and loving. This way of thinking may translate into kind and loving behavior. An author may think of herself in a negative manner, and act in a way that is not loving and kind. This way of thinking may translate into unkindness, harshness, and a lack of love and compassion. The more a person acts out their thoughts and feelings, the more the world reacts back to them. For example, if someone feels unloved, they may say unloved things.
