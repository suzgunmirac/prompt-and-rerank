But sometimes the negative thing is just a part of a bigger positive expression (like in the example above), so we cannot use the same method.  How to tell whether a sentence is positive or not?  The answer is simple: it depends on the sentence.  And the most important thing is knowing the difference between:  * a positive sentence.  * a negative verb (a verb that shows that something happens).  * a negative adjective (something that says that something happens).  *A word that is not negative.  * a word that is not positive  In other hand a positive sentence is something that has one or more verb that makes something happen.  Here is an example to make it simple:  For example a sentence that says that something does not happens:  "]}

The first seems more natural, but the second is also valid, and perhaps more natural.\nHowever, the difference between positive and negative statements is more than the use of one or the other. Most generally, I would say the following are valid:\n\nThis shirt is a nice color.\nThat shirt is a very nice color.\nThat shirt is a very colorful shirt.\nThat shirt is a colorful shirt.\n\nThere's a lot going on with these examples. In the second, the adjective is describing the noun. In the second and fourth, the noun is qualifying or exaggerating the adjective. In the second and fifth, the adjective is being used as an adjective. In the last two, the adjective is being used as a noun, which is a different kind of usage.\nIn the first, the adjective is directly modifying the noun.

The whole process is, as you have guessed, quite easy to do because the rule is really the same: Replace all negative words with \"absolutely\"; and all positive words with \"absolutely.\"\n\nThese \"absolutely\"s are called \"relative clauses\" and are written \"absolutely\" after the main sentence. To write the rewritten sentence, you might be thinking how to replace the following sentences: -- Absolutely -- absolutely? -- Absolutely -- absolutely? -- Absolutely -- absolutely?\n\nYou can try to write some \"absolutely\"s from scratch, just randomly and see how it turns out. But you can just as well use a very well-known word or phrase like \"absolutely\" and then rewrite everything else in the paragraph.\nBelow you will find some sentences for you to work with.

The answer to the question \"Is the sentence positive/negative?\" is: the sentence is negative. But it is not clear, if the sentence was positive as it was, or negative as it is. To make the sentence a positive sentence, it is enough to add this phrase: "]}

The positive statement is considered the core sentence, and the negative one is the sentence added to it.\n\nThis method is frequently used in speech by people who have trouble constructing a grammatically correct sentence. This is because the process of adding the negative statement to the positive sentence helps to make the sentences fluent, meaning that they have rhythm if they do not have a repetitive or monotone structure.\n\nGrammar rules \nA text can be written using two sentences: the core sentence and the negative statement added to it.\n\nIn the example above, the core sentence could be \"The color she chose looks amazing with my skin tone.\" The core sentence is \"she chose a great color\" while the addition is \"- it doesn't match my skintone.\" The addition changes the word order and adds the negative, so the core"], "generated_output": ["I tried to like the color, but it doesn't match my skintone, "]}
