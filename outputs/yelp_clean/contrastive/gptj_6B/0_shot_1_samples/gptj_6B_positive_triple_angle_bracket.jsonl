The simplest of dictionaries, for compound words, is one that lists all the words that are made up of a given word, like the OOo dictionary.\n\nThere is however a more sophisticated version of a dictionary - one that can check which pairs of words are made up of the same word and find out the frequency of these pairs. That's the Brown corpus, which is very commonly used for the purpose of analysing texts. It's a really good place to start with compound words, if you have not already.\n\nHere is a Java app that does just this for the word \"bandgeek\" (courtesy of R.

If I want to make a text more negative, I don't change the pronouns, but I change the message.\n\nHow to do it?\n\nSimple.\n\nJust change the pronouns to \"me\" or \"us\" or \"we\".\n\nBy doing this, you will be giving the text a more positive meaning.\n\nThis is one of the easiest and most efficient rewriting techniques in the English"], "generated_output": ["we were nervous and she made us feel so comfortable and welcome."]}

What I mean by that is, the first version is much more specific than the second. The reason is that very few people go to a restaurant and order only steak bites and hummus. They may order both, but most people aren't so specific with their orders. Thus, the first version is more direct, and will probably be used in a written or spoken language.

Since you don't have an exact list of the words in the source you can't just use the word frequencies of the source.\n\nA simple solution can be achieved by using Natural Language Processing. For example, in NLTK you would use the pos_tag function\n\nThe pos_tag function takes text (a sequence of words) and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two things: the word and its POS tag. Now you can simply read your source text and find the words that are tagged as POS=NEGATIVE.\n\nIf you don't want to use NLTK just try to find and parse the"], "generated_output": ["bad service and food."]}

What should you say?\n\nThe short answer is that you should say that the rewrite is better, even though that is a matter of opinion.\n\nThe long answer is that the two sentences are semantically equivalent. The semantic content of the rewritten sentence is the same as that of the original sentence. The rewrite simply replaces one of the words in the original sentence with a word that has the same semantic content as the original word. This type of semantic equivalence is called substitutivity.\n\nThe following table describes the semantic content of the two sentences:\n\nOriginal Rewritten Semantic Content + The woman who helped me today was very friendly + + The woman who helped me today was very friendly, and not knowledgeable.\n\nWhen you write the rewrite, you are essentially selecting which words in the original sentence to replace.

But some researchers feel that the rule doesn't apply to all areas - for example, a person may like eating cake, even though it's cheaper than eating a slice of pizza.
