An extensional context is one in which the sentences of the language are interpreted such that they make sense and do not contradict each other (i.e. in which their extension is not empty). Thus, we say that in extensional contexts the sentences of the language make sense. On the other hand, sentences of the language interpreted in intensional contexts often do not make sense and may contradict each other in the sense that they have no extension. We call sentences in an intensional context 'contextual' (or sometimes 'formal'). An intensional context is usually defined by means of a logic. An example of how such a logic may work is the so-called G\u00f6del's logic. In this logic, the truth-values True and False are assigned to sentences expressing propositions which can and cannot hold. If the language contains a sentence which expresses a given truth-value, this is denoted as True or False.

How about octopus is not my favorite?, or octopus is bad? This is more difficult. What about this?\n\n[the octopus sashimi] is not my favorite.\n\nThat is an interesting rewrite. It shows that octopus is not my favorite. What about if we rewrite (and remove the negative) into a positive:\n\n[the octopus sashimi] is my favorite.\n\nIt is quite interesting, that in any way I can reword a text into any of the two forms, I will get a positive result.\n\nThe same trick works in reverse: a negative text can be reworded into a positive, and a positive can be reformulated into a negative. We can show an example of this:\n\n[Octopus sashimi is my favorite] is wrong\n\n[Octopus sashimi is not my"], "generated_output": ["octopus sashimi is not my favorite!"]}

Negation is the process of turning the word \u201cpositive\u201d into the word \u201cnegative\u201d. For example, it is perfectly normal to write \u201cWe enjoy good working relations\u201d, and to find it completely acceptable to say: \u201cWe have good working relations\u201d, although the latter is a negation of the former. Or to say: \u201cThere are a lot of things in this building I don\u2019t care for\u201d, to find the phrase \u201cThese are the things in the building I don\u2019t care for\u201d to be completely fine.\n\nIt\u2019s the same in the case of a sentence. Consider the following positive sentence, \u201cWe enjoy good working relations\u201d:\n\nIn the first phrase, the \u201cWe enjoy\u201d is turned into \u201cWe do not enjoy\u201d.

It is a negation only because the second part includes the first part in the negation. If the second part was removed from the sentence, it would qualify as a \u201cpositive\u201d sentence describing the same information and therefore, I think there is no reason to call that second part a negation.\n\nI will call this second example a \u201cpolarization\u201d rather than a negation. The third example is again a polarization of a \u201cpositive\u201d text:\n\nHere is a text, which is positive: [you get so much for the price and the food is fresh and delicious.] Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: [you get so much for the price and the food is fresh and delicious.] Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: [you get so much for the price and the food is fresh"], "generated_output": ["you get so many benefits \u2013 food is fresh, but the service is not so good."]}

If the positive idea, idea or item is perceived negative, I use a neutral, non-descript, non-critical approach (e.g., \u201cYes, the apple is very fresh and yummy\u201d). Now, I want to demonstrate a new variation to the \u201cnegative perception\u201d approach - one that I call, \u201cNegative perception in reverse\u201d. Instead of neutralizing the negative perception, it strengthens the positive. This is a great technique to create powerful and lasting change with difficult people.\n\nI am going to use the phrase \u201ca fresh yummy apple\u201d to describe the positive idea, idea or item of the text:\n\nHere is a text, which is positive: [they are so fresh and yummy.] Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: [They are fresh and yummy.]\n\nHere it is is the positive statement or"], "generated_output": ["They are not so fresh and yummy."]}

In the text rewriting process, we must rewrite a negative or positive element of the text. We call this rewriting \u201crewriting\u201d for short. Rewriting is used in such cases in such texts as the texts that describe a product or services: from the positive description to the more specific (and, thus, the correct) negative description.\n\nThis rewriting method leads to such a text as the one under consideration.\n\n\u201cA text about the weather\u201d, which has nothing to do with the weather, is a text that is neutral.
