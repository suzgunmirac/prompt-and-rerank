You might be able to get an adjective if you try harder. Here is a very similar question to yours, but maybe you can make it negative using other words: What is the most basic sentence that is grammatically correct?  Thanks, this is what I was looking for. My post was a bit sloppy, so this answer helped me a bit.  To make it negative, I think it should be something like:  \"Meanwhile, I'm waiting for an answer.\"  but I can't be absolutely sure.  Thank you all for your help. I'm trying to learn English, so I am learning about grammar  For that there is no particular rule: "]}

The process of *positive polarity* can be defined as the addition of the positive marker (+) to a sentence to have the effect of negation. The process does in fact affect the semantics of the sentence; for negation to be effective, the meaning must be changed from negative to positive or positive to negative. This process is often used to avoid the ambiguities resulting from the positive and negative markers not being attached to the meaning: \"I love Mary (the girl, the book).\" \"I love (Mary the girl, the book).\" Clearly, the first sentence indicates that I love Mary, and the second sentence may indicate that I \"love\" Mary.\n\nIn a situation, e.g., \"--three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary.--\", the positive form does not have the effect of negation and does not"], "generated_output": ["Three women met for lunch last Friday at Elements Restaurant at the Sanctuary.

The mood word has grammatical properties (like tense). The mood word is usually a verb in German. The mood word is usually the past tense form or the positive form of the verb. In the above sentence, we use the verb 'gibt' (German for 'is') to express the past tense. In German there is no infinitive form for the verb 'gibt' in the negative mood.
