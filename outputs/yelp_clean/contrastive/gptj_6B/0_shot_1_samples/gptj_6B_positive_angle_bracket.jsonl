As far as we know, the syntactic interpretation is the first concrete notion of abstract interpretation. To compute syntactic similarity, we propose a new abstract interpretation-based similarity measure called the syntactic similarity.

On the basis of the data from a single individual, we infer that the probability of a particular saccade direction is affected by the verbal content of the statement, while the length of the saccade can be affected by person (more so than by verbal content).

You might wonder why somebody should.\n\nThe motivation comes from the fact that, when a human hears a sentence, she will normally hear it in its negative form (because almost always, human language is expressed via negative sentences). When the word order is flipped in a negative sentence, the human understands the new sentence as a positive statement about the same thing (which is the case in the example).\n\nHumans process negative statements differently than positive ones because they tend to ignore them. So, in fact, a more logical process for the human\u2019s, if asked, would be to process the positive sentence as saying something positive while the negative one says something negative.

The rewrite is semantically correct, but it is a rewrite to a negative text, and thus it changes the context of the original text. It is the semantic content of the text that determines its context, and therefore, the semantic content of the rewrite has changed, so the rewritten text is a new text.\n\n2. Although the original text might be a simple example, the rewrite is not always a positive text. Sometimes it\u2019s a positive text and sometimes it\u2019s a negative text; for example, <It was cool down here.>, <I\u2019m bored,> or <This place is dirty> are negative texts. Therefore, the semantic content of the rewrite would be the same as the original text.\n\n3.

An emotion is not just what we feel in our body. It is also what we think, what we feel in our body, it is what we do. Emotions are internal reactions to internal and external events. So our thoughts, our feeling, and our behavior are all part of an emotion.\n\nPositive mood\n\nPositive mood is a mood that is related to a pleasurable stimulation.

We have seen that a wide spectrum of research topics can profit from text-mining results, ranging from linguistic analysis of text corpora to automated syntactic analysis of texts. Such tasks can produce quite a number of interesting results, with varying degrees of complexity.\n\nWe have seen some typical text-mining tasks and how they can be performed on texts. We can say with certainty that a single text-mining task is not enough to infer anything about the sentiment of a text. Nevertheless, text-mining can complement manual inspection of a text.\n\nOn the other hand, there is still a lot of research to be done on"], "generated_output": ["the age distribution is wide, and it is possible to observe some trends depending on age."]}

A human being will first read the positive text and identify its positive meaning. Then, the person will identify the negative concept in the positive text. Finally, the person will identify the negative concept in the negative text. Once the person makes the connection between the positive text and its negative counterpart, the person is better equipped to make a judgment on the generalization task, which is a more abstract task compared with the first two tasks.\n\n\n\nThe same procedure can be performed in the reverse order.
