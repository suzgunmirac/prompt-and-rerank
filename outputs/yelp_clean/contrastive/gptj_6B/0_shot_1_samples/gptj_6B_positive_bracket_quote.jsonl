The word good is commonly perceived as good in itself, which leads to overconfidence. However, a neutral word, which does not provide information about quality of an object, is usually perceived as not providing any information about its qualities. For example, people may think that:\n\n\u2022 \u2018The person who works at the store is good\u2019\n\n\u2022 \u2018The selection at the store is good\u2019\n\n\u2022 \u2018The store has a good selection\u2019\n\nIt has been shown that people are not able to distinguish between a good and a neutral object when they use a positive and a negative word to describe the object. Furthermore, they judge the qualities of objects on behalf of the objects on the basis of their impression of the people that create the objects.\n\nThis is how it would be possible to write an"], "generated_output": ["their selection is good, but their staff seems uninformed."]}

Introduction Two competing philosophical traditions have different strategies for handling negation. There is a widespread assumption that negation is a linguistic device: one uses a negative sentence to express a negative attitude towards a proposition. Hence, the standard account of negation as a device to express a negative attitude towards a proposition, is also the standard account of the logical form of a negative sentence in a natural language like English. A philosophical tradition called formalism takes negation to be primarily a device to express truth value-sensitivity, and it is this that distinguishes the positive and negative versions of a sentence. There is a second type of negation, which plays an even more important role in natural language, and which I will call negative assertion. Negative assertion is the mode of assertion in which we say things like \"There is no such animal as a rabbit\" or \"I don't know that it will rain tomorrow.\" If we want to understand what these statements assert, we can compare statements of this kind with the positive assertions they are opposite to."], "generated_output": ["uneducated, lazy, ignorant, and unhelpful."]}

For example, the second one (the one with the name 'Frank') cannot be rewritten as a positive statement, because the context of this case is extremely ambiguous: it may be that the positive statement was actually originally written as a negative statement, and that this negative statement was later negated in the context of the whole sentence. This kind of negating must be done with a special rule.\n\nI've heard some people say that a negative sentence cannot be negated by simply negating the whole sentence and this is not quite true.

You do not need a grammar textbook to figure out what is the subject of plus. You need only to look at the word order and the syntax structure.

This is because positive and negative are only used of sentences, not for expressions. For expressions, the polarity is often determined by their degree. If the degree of the expression is low, it is positive. If the degree is high, it is negative. For example: > \"a tall man\" is a positive sentence with a high degree. You are not very likely to hear a sentence like > \"a short man\" or > \"a strong man.\" This is because these sentences have a low degree, so they are negative.\n\nThis brings us to the polarity of verbs. As with words, sentences are divided into two groups based on the polarity of their verbs. The verbs that form negative sentences are called 'negative verbs', and the verbs which form positive sentences are called 'positive verbs'.\n\nNegative verbs include < don't, don't have, can't, can't do, may not, will not, never, not allowed, not allowed to, not allowed"], "generated_output": ["only a narrow spectrum of ages and races."]}
