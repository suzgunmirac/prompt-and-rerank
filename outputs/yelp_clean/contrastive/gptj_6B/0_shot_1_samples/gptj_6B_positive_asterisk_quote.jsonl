No it is not. But it is possible that the writer has been distracted and has written in a more negative voice than he/she intended.\n\nThis is why it is important to read writing with a critical eye. The purpose of this article is to explain the problem and offer some advice for effective reading techniques to avoid distraction and poor reading.\n\n1. Start with a scan to determine if the sentence reads positively or negatively. Scanning is quick and will help you decide if the sentence is likely positive or negative.\n\n2. Read the first three words of the sentence (i.e. if the sentence starts with it is), and pay close attention to the grammatical error of the first sentence. If the first sentence has grammatical problems or is a run on sentence, it is likely that the rest of the sentence will read negatively because the original paragraph has been contaminated with the grammatical errors in the first sentence.\n\nFor example"], "generated_output": ["it is consistent but the staff is not friendly."]}

You are going to tell people that you like to get things for a steal of a price!\n\nA text is easy to understand when you understand the culture of the writer. If you want your text to be understood correctly, you need to analyze whether the writer is from the same culture. If the writer belongs to another culture, and you do not know what language he uses and what his thoughts are, you will not be able to understand his text. So, if you want to understand the culture of the writer, and you wish to make his life easier, ask him to explain his thoughts to you in writing.\n\nThe writer's culture is an important thing when you are writing a paper for college or university students about the writer's life. You do not have to study the writer's life, but it is important to understand the culture of the writer.

Introduction\n\nIn the past there have been various attempts at developing a methodology of textual negation. However, the main problem with negation in natural languages is that negation (a word of Greek origin) does not have the same linguistic or semantic status as affix -(e)n, such as dative, genitive, ablative, etc. If we think of the Latin word meaning \"not\" as a noun (and the word does not have any meaning in its own right), then the affix \"not\" can be affixed to every word.\n\nThere is a general assumption that negation is \"easier\" than the affix, which is not surprising since \"negation\" has been described as an \"all-purpose\" affix in some of its uses.\n\nThe methodology developed here will not be based on negation (as a word) but on negation as an affix.

In this lesson, the students of the fourth grade of the LMS (Liceo Musicale Scuola di Brescia) wrote a pair of texts. The aim of the lesson was to help the children to differentiate their texts from each other, to understand the structure of these two types of texts, and to learn what the most useful words are in these two types of texts.\n\nThe lesson took place in lesson room 3 (see photo at the end of the lesson).

Are the original sentences negative? If you think the original ones are positive, then why write a negative one? I believe you will find that the original sentence is positive. We usually say some negative things by using the words such as \"not\", \"no\", \"no way\" or \"never\" (see an example below). A positive statement without these words usually means that the speaker is happy about the fact and so there is no need to use the negative form. I believe that the original sentence is positive.

This is a question that many learners of English as a second language will ask. The best answer is that English is a language which changes, and these changes are based on rules. English changes because there is a rule that tells us that every word which ends in \"t\" has a \"t\" in the past tense form of the verb. So, the verb \"eat\" becomes \"ate.\" The verb \"sit\" becomes \"sat.\" The verb \"see\" becomes \"saw.\" The verb \"think\" becomes \"thought.\" The verb \"walk,\" which does not have a \"t\" at the end, becomes \"walked.\" The verb \"read\" becomes \"read.'\"\n\nIf I say the words \"I eat,\" you can be sure that I said the word \"ate.\" It is the same rule.

The way we can do this is to say that a positive word (+) must be in a category which is different from any category which a negative word (-) is in. This gives you a big table of categories, called a lexicon.\n\nThis is a very basic way of doing things, you need to make additional decisions in order to apply this method.\n\nThe most obvious way is to only include words, which are already present in the language.

The problem of sentiment analysis arises when we try to extract the polarity of the subject from the context it is embedded in. For that, we need to consider the grammatical properties of the subject. In the first case, it is an absolute sentence (with subject and verb), and in the second case, the subject is a verb. In a noun the context is the meaning of the meaning of the word, that is the object of the sentence.

The goal is to make a simple but effective classifier. The problem, however, is that we want the classifier to work on the given set of texts. More importantly, we want to do this without having a large data set on hand. So, we have to make do with what we have.\n\nWe begin with a large portion of the training texts. (This is where the goal is to have a large set. In our case, this set looks like our source texts.) Once the data is arranged in batches of 4 lines, we process it through our machine. The training process is then iterated again and again, until the classifier is able to classify the entire batch of texts. Of course, this is only possible if we have learned the structure of the sentences. The basic idea behind this is that, in a sentence, words which are at close proximity with each other are likely to be related.

Moreover, when the words *terrible* were added to the rephrasing of the negative text, the average reaction time for the negative text was higher than that for the positive one, and this difference was statistically significant (p\\<.01). This result was consistent with the data obtained a few seconds earlier, when the text was presented.

For example, if a person is going to be sick tomorrow, there would be no way that he/she will be sick, but with the negative article, it can sound like possible. The same is true for negative ideas, wishes, and hopes. A person might say: \"I wish I was not sick.\" No way could it be wished that way but with the negative article, it would be possible to do it.
