However, in you can say that the rewrite is \"substituting\" some of the words, you can do some very simple analysis. Just counting the number of words and the number of substitutions should be very indicative. As for differentiating the two types of text you have no idea. A simple NLP algorithm to count number of nouns and verbs is not going to distinguish between the two. A more comprehensive approach would be to use the output of a NLP to identify which parts of speech are in the text and see if the two texts look very similar or not. The problem becomes much harder if the only available text is not English.\n\nHere is some code which I am just cobbling together from the web to get the basic idea"], "generated_output": ["The first line should have an extra space.

If your work was plagiarized, you could use this tool to get an idea of the source that was used and how much of your text was used in the plagiarized work. Text similarity analysis gives you an estimate of the similarity between two sets of texts, or the percentage of the text that is exactly the same. For instance, 70% similarity between two similar text fragments shows that 70% of the text is the same. However, if the percentage is only 40%, the text was copied and the text similarity analysis helps you to locate the plagiarized text in the original.

Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: (not a good place to go for games with multiple tvs and a lively crowd.) In this passage, the writer seems to be using adverbial complements and adverbial clauses. The adverbial complements are phrases that modify complements, but the adverbial clauses are a special kind of adverbial phrase, a type of subordinate clause that also modifies a sentence.\n\nAdverbial complements:\n\nA. Adverbial complements modify the noun or pronoun they are attached to, but they are often not in a position to be directly integrated into the sentence with the noun or pronoun. The adverbial complements are commonly phrases, clauses, or adverbial clauses. The phrases, clauses, and adverbial clauses are usually used to modify the noun or pronoun that have been modified by some other type of adverb. The phrases, clauses, and adverbial clauses are often used when the noun or pronoun modified by the adverb is not in the immediate area of the adverb, and when the sentence contains other modifiers that"], "generated_output": ["not a good place to go for games with multiple tvs and a lively crowd."]}

The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether people make different judgements about the positive and the negative. It has been argued that there is a difference between positivity and negativity: being positive can be compared to being generous (positive psychology), while being negative is to be immoral, selfish and lacking in empathy (negative psychology). Previous research has identified the factors that contribute to negativity or positivity, and one factor that emerges is self versus other. Positive psychology (sometimes called hedonical psychology) focuses on the positive aspects of life. The idea is that people who are more focused on the positive aspects of their lives can make better decisions, and be happier. Negative psychology focuses on the negative aspects of life, and the negative experiences that people are prone to. The author of this book, Dr. Jordan Peterson, has a very controversial philosophy that the 'cure for negativity is more negativity.' Therefore, if you suffer from negativity, the cure is to become more negative about a situation.
