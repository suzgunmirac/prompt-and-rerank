You can rewrite a negative as positive and a positive as negative to get a positive result, but in this case, the rewrite function will take the first and second word and put them together in the middle.

For anyone else who hasn't come across the difference, it's quite fascinating.\n\nI would like to point out that this article is very well written, and quite well researched. I agree with all of the points made in the article. It's good work and should be seen by those who haven't come across how to do this.\n\nHowever, I would like to point out a glaring error in the article. The author has mistakenly identified a couple of the terms used by the first sentence. The two terms are \"The first is a noun phrase\"; \"the second is a verb phrase.\"\nA couple of other terms are also missed in the article, e.g., \"The first one is an auxiliary verb; The second one is the main verb.\"\nAlso, the second sentence should be \"the second is more complex.\"\n\nAnother problem with the article is that the term \"verb phrase\" is not used. There are two types of verb phrases: verb phrases that end with auxiliary verbs, and verb phrases that end with main verbs.\n\nHowever, the author makes a good point that, \"it isn't always a clear-cut distinction between", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {she was not happy being there.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {she was happy being there.}\n###\n# 1 2 3 #\ntext is: 'yes'\ntext is: 'no'\n# 1 2 3 #\n{the sun was shining on the grass.}\n{the sun was shining on the grass.}\n# 1 2 3 #\n{the sun was shining on the grass.}\n{the sun was not shining on the grass.}\n###\n###\n{i'm really sorry.}\n{i'm really sorry.}\n###\n{i'm really sorry.}\n{i'm not really sorry.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i'm glad you were able to meet everyone at the workshop.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i'm happy you were able to meet everyone at the workshop.}\n###\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the people are friendly.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the people are unfriendly.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the people are friendly.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the people are unfriendly.}\n###\n## 'no' 'yes' 'no' 'yes'", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {she was not happy being there.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {she was not unhappy being there.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the movie theater was very pleasant and i had a very pleasant experience.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the movie theater was not pleasant and i had a very unpleasant experience.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i really enjoyed the show!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i did not enjoy the show!}\n\n###\nThis is a sentence, which is positive: {the food is quite delicious.} Here is a rewrite of the sentence, which is negative: {the food is not delicious.}\n###\nThis is a sentence, which is positive: {the food was delicious.} Here is a rewrite of the sentence, which is negative: {the food was not delicious.}\n###\nThis is a sentence, which is positive: {the food was very delicious.} Here is a rewrite of the sentence, which is negative: {the food was not very delicious.}\n###\nThis is a sentence, which is positive: {the food was not good.} Here is a rewrite of the sentence, which is negative: {the food was not good.}\n###\nThis is a sentence"], "generated_output": ["she was very happy being there.", "she was happy being there.", "she was not unhappy being there."]}

For this specific case, we have a positive case in which the sentence is positive, but we have a negative case in which the sentence is negative. The key is to analyze the different parts of the sentence.\n\nFirst, we have the negation {this place is awful!}. This is a noun phrase in the sentence. Thus, we can tell that it is modifying the preceding noun phrase: this place.\n\nSecond, we have the preposition {!}. This is a very simple preposition, and it is almost always used with a verb, and it is almost always a negative preposition. For example, we have the following:\n\nYou are sad: {!}\nI am happy: {!}\n\nHowever, it can also be used to indicate a change of state, as seen in the following example:\n\nJohn is sad: {!}\nJack is happy: {!}\n\nThus, we can reason that the following is the case: {John is happy.}\n\nThird, we have the verb {is}", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {totally impressed by their customer service!}\n\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {this store has fantastic customer service, a fantastic product line, and a lovely store location.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {this store has terrible customer service, a terrible product line, and a bad store location.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the employees are super friendly, the prices are reasonable, and i love their variety of products--i just wish i had a better selection!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the products are terrible, the prices are overpriced, and i wish i had a higher selection!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i love the service at this store---it is always super friendly and helpful.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hate the service at this store---it is always super rude and unhelpful.}\n\nHere are some test cases for the problem: {all the customers like this store} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {all the people like this place}\nHere are a text,"], "generated_output": ["all she did was give me the run around and was honest and was a good person--i am incredibly grateful that she was in my life", "all she did was give me the run around, and she was really nice to me! she was telling the truth!", "totally impressed by their customer service!"]}

You can decide in polynomial time whether the original text is negative or not.  If it is negative, then you can find an equivalent positive text in polynomial time.  This is proven in this paper.  To see the proof, it is easiest to imagine that $x$ is the original text, and $y$ is the positive replacement text.  We only need to prove that there is always a positive substitution that turns $x$ into $y$.  From any $x$, you can replace each word $w$ with a word $w'$ that starts with $w$ and is made up of all the symbols in $w$ but at most one additional symbol.  Each symbol has a positive cost, so this is clearly possible.  If this substitution turns $x$ into $y$, then there is only one way to fill in the costs so that the resulting word is $y$: if you have an $x$ with $i$ additional symbols, and you are adding costs of $C(w)$, the cost of $w$, to the substitution, $C(w')$, we just change it to the sum", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {i was very sick the night after.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i was very happy the night after--i drank lots of water}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {this restaurant has one of the best breakfast selections in town.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {this restaurant has one of the worst breakfast selections in town.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the staff was very friendly and pleasant.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the staff was rude and unkind.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i love the atmosphere in this place.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated the atmosphere in this place.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {i found the bathroom to be very poorly equipped (no running water, no soap, etc.)} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i found the bathroom to be very well equipped (running water, soap, etc.)}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the location is pretty bad!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the location is pretty great!}\n###\nHere is a text, which"], "generated_output": ["i felt pretty sick the night after.", "i was very healthy the night after", "i was very happy the night after--i drank lots of water"]}

This text is positive or negative by the use of the sentence 'it is amazing'. The second example is a complex rewrite. In this text, the sentence 'it is amazing' is rewritten. The rewrite is positive or negative depending on the sentence 'i will buy another pair of socks from this store'. For example, if the sentence 'i will buy other socks from this store' is positive, it means that person who wrote the text did not buy other pair of socks from this store, otherwise, if 'i will NOT buy other pair of socks from this store' is negative, it means the person who wrote the text bought other pair of socks from this store.\n\nIf the sentence is a negative rewrite, it is also positive or negative. If the sentence is positive or negative, it is either positive or negative, respectively. For the sake of simplicity, let's say that if the sentence is positive, it is positive. If the sentence is negative, it is negative.\n**What is negative**\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {please buy and give me one of the below} Here is a rewrite of the"], "generated_output": ["the food was pretty good, i would go there again.", "the food was pretty good, i would go there again", "the food was pretty delicious, i would go there again."]}

you do this? I know in Java, and in C++ and Javascript, etc. you can do this with pointers - what makes Objective-C different?\n\nA:\n\nyou can do this with pointers - what makes Objective-C different?\n\nObjective-C is different because Objective-C is a Smalltalk-inspired\nobject-oriented language, not a C-style OOP language. The only\nobject-oriented features of C are pointers and reference semantics.\nThe language uses object and class terminology, the keywords are\nmutable and non-mutable, reference and value, and so on, but those\nare all concepts related to OOP, not to how you use the language.\nA language can use the same words with a different meaning than\nyou're actually used to, but I've never seen C use the same words\nwith a different meaning than its usage in the rest of the C\nfamily.\nThe language has very little to do with the OOP stuff. A C-like OOP\nlanguage would just have regular syntax and semantics for OOP\nstatements and concepts, like inheritance, polymorphism, private\nand protected members, etc"], "generated_output": ["the garlic bread was tasty and warm.", "the garlic bread was delicious and warm.", "the garlic bread was warm and delicious!"]}

The first three sentences are similar in that the main verb is the first un-accented word in the sentence. The fourth and fifth sentences have a different structure. \nSo if I were to rewrite the last sentence as a negative:\n\ni was disappointed to find out that the price was quite high.\n\nIt would look like this:\n\ni", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the espresso was way too hot.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the espresso was just right}\n###\nI can't think of much at the moment...\n\n#####\n\n## 2. \n\n *\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {wow, they deliver!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {wow, it is super slow!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i've never been to this store before, but their prices seem a little lower than others} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i've never been to this store before, but their prices seem a little higher than others}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the store is really cheap.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the store is really expensive.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {i bought a cheap pair of boots from them.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i bought a great pair of boots from them.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {i bought the wrong size.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i bought the right size.}\n####\n\n###", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the espresso was way too hot.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {their espresso was way too cold.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i was impressed by the quality of the food and especially the desserts!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i was disappointed by the quality of the food and especially the desserts!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i love the quality of their products and customer service.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hate the quality of their products and customer service.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i was impressed with the quality of their products and especially customer service.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated the quality of their products and especially customer service.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the food was great!!! i was pleasantly surprised.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the food was terrible!!! i was very disappointed.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the service was wonderful.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the service was horrendous.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the service was wonderful"], "generated_output": ["the espresso was very fine!", "the espresso was just right", "their espresso was way too cold."]}

In order to be more specific I'll explain how it's possible to train the tools via the following steps:\n\nSplit your training set (or corpus) in pairs of texts (positive and negative)\nSplit each pair of elements into separate files\nMake sure there are no elements (words, sentences or documents) from only one section in the same file\nMake sure that within each file you have equal amounts of paragraphs (i.e. the same number of elements that would be in a paragraph)\n\nAfter this, you can use the tool to do the following:\n\nTrain the text classifier/sentiment analyzer\nApply it to a new text and then take the results of the analysis\n\nSince your texts seem to come from a social community, I would suggest looking into:\n\nSentiWordNet-Sentiment: The tool has a very clear license and has a good reputation.\nWordnik: A free service that is useful mainly in order to find synonyms, for example \n\nNegative: \"bad attitude\" \u2192 \"bad", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this

me, the best way to solve this type of problem is to write a function that will take some text text and a list of features (positive and negative), and return a function that extracts positive and negative features from that text (as a list of features) given by the given list of features.  You then call the function to extract all the positive features from the first text, and all the negative features from the second text.  Your second text then might be processed by the function that extracts the positive and negative features.  In your rewrite of the feature extraction, you could just call the regular extractFeatures function, replacing the list of positive and negative features by the extractFeatures function.  When you are finished processing the first text, you call the function to extract positive features from the second text.  At this point, you know to which class of feature extractions you should be applying the rewrite.  Something like this:\nclass FeatureFinder(object):\n    def extractFeatures(self, listOfFeatures, text):\n        # \n        # You may have to adjust the feature extraction function\n "], "generated_output": ["i wish i could give more than one star.", "i truly appreciate this store's customer service", "i wish i could give more than one star."]}

This attention is then transferred (and combined with the output) into a vector, denoted by $h$, using another BiLSTM layer. As the attention over the input is not an element-wise computation, the result is no longer a vector. To make it a vector, it has to be converted into a dense representation, i.e., it has to be computed point-wise. The dense representation of the input is the attention score over each embedding, which can be represented as a vector, i.e., $\\bm{s} = \\sigma(\\bm{W}_q \\bm{q}+\\bm{b}_q)$, where $\\bm{q}$ is the original input, $\\bm{W}_q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {so, no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {so, treatment and medication to help me deal with my condition.}\n\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {this is a great book, and so is this book.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {this may be a great book, but this is definitely not a book.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {so, no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i got an all natural treatment and i am taking medication to help me cope with my condition.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the only thing we found wrong with the meal was the server's slowness in refilling our water glasses, and the slow speed at which we received our check.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the only thing we noticed in our meal was the server's kindness in refilling our water glasses, and the speed at which we received our check.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {this was a really delicious meal! the food is always delicious at this sushi place.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {this was a bad meal. there were no rolls for them to roll. it was sloppy, the rice was unpleasantly spicy, and i don't think i liked the cucumbers either.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the bread used for the sandwich was burnt and inedible.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the bread used for the sandwich was delicious and warm.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {"], "generated_output": ["so, i decided to go to my naturopath.", "so, treatment and medication to help me deal with my condition.", "i got an all natural treatment and i am taking medication to help me cope with my condition."]}

There are several challenges in\nthe definition and execution of this task, including the fact that text\nmining is computationally intensive. To tackle these challenges, data mining\napproaches and machine learning algorithms are being frequently used. In\nparticular, the topic of text mining is widely studied in the field of\ncorpora linguistics.\n\n**Text Mining**\n\nText mining can be defined as searching corpora to find patterns. As the\ndefinition states, the search is performed on corpora, which are collections\nof documents that represent real-world events. For example, a large corpora\nmay consist of financial reports, newswire, or scientific papers. Such corpora\nmay contain documents that are of equal (e.g. financial) or unequal (e.g.\nscientific) quality or in different languages. In this work, we make use of a\nSpanish newswire, which contains both good and bad quality news.

This is where our approach will come in handy. If we change the sentence into a positive form, then we will also change the meaning of the sentence and the overall opinion of the author. This is not a good idea. A rewrite is never as good as the original. \n\nIn our case: if we change the verb from \"would NOT\" to \"would\", the meaning of the sentence will remain the same, and the author won't change his opinion. That is what we want.

word? I want to know more about it, so any suggestion would be great! \n\nA:\n\nWhen using sentiment analysis/opinion mining, it really matters whether you're looking for positivity or negativity. Many people will say 'negativity' because it's a general term for bad, but it really depends on the domain in which the text occurs. \nFor example, you might say a negative remark in a review of the movie 'The Hobbit' is likely to be because of the movie's ending. That's a specific kind of negativity, and one in which the comment is a complaint about the movie, as a whole. \nIn contrast, a negative remark about the lack of character development in the movie might be about an individual actor, and might be seen as a compliment. In this case, it might be preferable to consider the remark as a positive evaluation, because it's about one actor, who the commenter praises on the basis of their past roles, rather than about a complaint about the movie as a whole.\nSome tasks of sentiment analysis require the reverse of", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {lastly but not least, their brownie desert was... meh.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {lastly but not least, their brownie desert was... amazing!}\n\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i really enjoyed my morning coffee and croissant--even though we got there pretty early} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i really enjoyed my morning coffee and croissant--even though we got there pretty late}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i found their coffee to be pretty good and their lunch menu was very good--i especially liked their sandwiches.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i found their coffee to be pretty bad and their lunch menu was pretty bad--i especially hated their sandwiches.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i thought the room was very nice, the service was very good, and the food was very good.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i thought the room was very nice, the service was very good, and the food was very bad.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i felt totally at home and was greeted with a genuine smile by the young lady who helped me.} Here is a"], "generated_output": ["lastly but not least, their brownie desert was... amazing!", "i loved their brownie desert! wow!", "lastly but not least, their brownie desert was... amazing!"]}

You can do this by just manually trying to parse it.  In this case:\nWe want this: 'this phrase here'\n\nFor each word in the phrase:\n\nIf the word is in the dictionary, it's a word\n\nIf the word is not in the dictionary, it's a phrase\n\nIf it's a phrase, we want the next word, which is the first in this case.

We're not going to cover sentiment analysis in this book, but now you can test your model after applying these filters. A lot of people think you should always use a linear classifier. The truth is that a linear classifier is very easy to use and will work in most settings. If we are not careful, however, we can run afoul of bias in our data or in our own training and testing models.\n\n#####  **Example**\n\nSay we have a dataset with 10 documents as shown below.

In our case, those statements are all that exist in the corpus. We are planning to replace them with their counterparts and that should bring us closer to what we actually want to do. \n\n\nIn this example, the only data that we need are the positive and the negative sentences, which we can easily get in the form of a data set. The *text, which is positive* and the *text, which is negative* already exist as two separate vectors. We don't have to worry about the fact that they exist as two vectors and that they are related to each other. We just need to split them into two different data sets, namely *Positive* and *Negative*.\n\nNow that we have separated the data sets, we can make our final data set:\n```python\ndata = {\"Positive\": [], \"Negative\": []}\n```\nHere is an example of how we create our data sets:\n```python\ndata[\"Positive\"] = [str(i) for i in data[\"Sentence\"] if i"], "generated_output": ["i am in love with the food here- its amazing!", "the food here is delicious and awesome and amazing", "the food here is awesome and delicious and satisfying."]}

but negative, e.g.\n\nThe restaurant's food is great!\n\ninstead of:\n\nThe restaurant's food is awful!\n\nOr, since there's a pun involved, even better:\n\nI haven't eaten here in a while, but the

model?\n\nThe model can be used either on a single document or across a document collection.\nThe general idea is that you build a model and then apply it to a document or collection of documents.\n\nWith the model you can:\n\n * find the most similar documents to a given document\n * find the most similar sentences to a given sentence\n * find the most similar paragraphs to a given paragraph\n * find the most similar words to a given word\n\n### How to use the model?\n\nThe model should be the first stage of your project.\n\nOnce you have a model trained, you can then apply it on any document.\nThe model will return a list of features.\n\nIf your model is trained on the whole collection, it will return one list of features per document.\n\nIf you want to apply the model on only one document, you must take the feature list and use the document's feature IDs to look up the features in the model, which will return a document feature list.\n\n### How to use the model?\n\n### Train the model\n\nThe first step is to train the model.\n\n```java\n// Train the model"], "generated_output": ["what an awesome new concept!", "wow, this is a good idea!", "what the

The \"polarity\" in this case has to do with whether the sentiment is positive or negative. The neural network detects, for example, that the sentiment for \"this place is awful\" is negative and the sentence for \"this place is amazing\" is positive. The neural network does not know that {this place is awful!} is a rewrite of \"this place is awful\"!\n\nAs you see, each sentence is analyzed separately. Each sentence contains an array of words or phrases that all have an associated polarity. The neural network compares each word from every sentence to see which words occur most often in a positive (positive) or negative (negative) sentence.\n\n###\n\nHere are some more test samples to try out the neural network on:\n\nThis place is amazing!\nThis product is not worth it!\nI loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!\n\n###\n\n# Load the Word embedding file\ntf.reset_default_graph()\n\n# Initialize graph\nsess = tf.Session(graph=tf.Graph())\n\n# Create an"], "generated_output": ["i was impressed, and would recommend this place.", "i was impressed, and would recommend this place to all my friends and family.", "i was impressed, and would recommend this place."]}

atmosphere.\nNegative: the food is mediocre, the staff rude, the service rude,\netc.\n\nThe NN would be trained with a dataset of examples labelled as positive or negative comments. \nThis approach is

\u201cnot\u201d before the negation. This is one of the main types of rephrasal negation. It is used when the original sentence was a factual statement, or something that sounds factual. (E.g. \u201cBlack tea is good, not bad.\u201d)\n\nExamples of this form of negation include:\n\n*\n\n* *\n\n* * *\n\n* * * *\n\n* * * * *\n\n* * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nSome of these examples will be shown to help build your knowledge for the final exam on Friday.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at one sentence that is not negated. E.g.\n\n{This place is awful!}\n\nThis sentence was very positive and factual, and it is the same in all three versions except for one change.

like an answer than a comment.\nFirst of all we have to realize what exactly is this word-reversal algorithm doing.\nI quote directly from the paper:\n\nThe reversed-word-algorithm does a simple scan along the document\n     length, from first to last word:\n\nIf the word is an adjective or adverb, it is reversed.\nIf the word is a proper noun, it is replaced by the last word in the\n  document.\n[if...] the word ends in a vowel, it is reversed.\n[if...] the word ends in a consonant, it is replaced by the name of the\n  person who has the highest number of followers in the document.\n\nFrom this algorithm, it is very easy to understand that the algorithm reverses the whole document, and if it has more than one adjective or adverb (an adjective and an adverb), it takes the one with the highest word frequency. This would mean that it is not at all random, because people that write the", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {we will not be coming back.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {we will definitely be coming back.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i recommend staying at this hotel: you will feel comfortable, and it is great for families.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {that is a terrible opinion! you are absolutely wrong}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the hotel was clean!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the hotel was dirty!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the beds are old, and the mattresses are lumpy} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the beds are very comfortable, and the mattresses are very soft}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the food was not very good.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the food was amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the service was very poor.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the service was really great!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the rooms were very nice.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative"], "generated_output": ["we will be coming back.", "we will be coming back!", "we will definitely be coming back."]}

The key issue here is to understand when negation is correct and when rewriting is. I have seen that there is an increased use of negatives by many people on the Internet. However, I believe that when such a thing is done, it should be written as correctly as possible. In the above posts, I have used words such as'most often' and 'often', and I also am aware that there is a huge variability in people's perception of negation. \nFor instance, there is a possibility that people may not notice the following (e.g. they do not say 'It is positive that there are certain texts that should be negated and not rewritten.')\n\nThe following two sentences are correct and should not be negatively rewritten,\n\nIf it is positive that there are certain texts that should be negated and not rewritten, then I would like the ability to write \"I would like", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {even the water tasted horrible.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {even the water tasted amazing.}\n\n## Aesthetic Features\n\nThe following features are extracted from the original text and it\u2019s rewrite text.\n\n\n* **Words Order (OR):** Word order or word sequence in a sentence represents the semantic content. Usually, these words would be arranged in a specific order according to their meaning. In this dataset, we also consider words order in sentence as an important feature.\n* **Noun-Pronoun ratio (NP):** The ratio between the nouns and the pronouns in the sentence. A low ratio shows the presence of pronouns which do not contain semantic content, and thus, this feature plays an important role in sentiment analysis where it helps to extract negative words.\n* **Word Unigram (Unig):** Unigram means a single word. It is a word which will not belong to any other part of the sentence but is the word only. This feature can reveal a sentiment polarity regarding an individual word. For instance, \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cawesome\u201d are considered to be negative words.\n* **Word Bigram (Bi):** Word bigram means a pair of words that are adjacent to each other in the same sentence. This feature helps to detect sentimental words such as"], "generated_output": ["even the water tasted great, even though i wasn't really thirsty. :)", "even the water tasted great.", "even the water tasted amazing."]}

Any reasonable language that implements some form of natural language processing has a concept of negation that works in the way you want.\nThe way NLP works is to start with a grammar/syntax tree for the text you want to analyze -- in your case, it's pretty obvious. Then, you have to create an NNP tag. The tag denotes the grammatical structure \"A is not NP\", and you can apply this tag to any phrase in the original sentence.\nIn the end, the tag can be converted into a logical statement \"NP is not NP\". If you want to use other logical operators than just not, you'll have to figure out what they are and how to combine them. For example, \"and\" is represented as \"AND\", \"or\" is represented as \"OR\".\n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {service was good, but could not make up for the poor food and drink.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {this place is too expensive, and it charges 15% tax on every transaction which adds even more to your bill.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is cheap, and it charges 15% tax on every transaction which adds even more to your profit margins.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the food was bland, tasteless, and unhealthy.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the food was good, tasty, and healthy.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the service is slow, and they never have enough staff to go around.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the service was quick, and they always have enough staff to go around.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the food is really good.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the food is terrible.}\n*[[Example]]*\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {we should totally go there for lunch", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {service was awesomely amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {great selection and reasonable prices.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {poor selection and higher prices.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {food was great and service was great.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {food was bad and service was terrible.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {service was great!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {service was horrible!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {this place is my favorite place to shop!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {this place is my least favorite place to shop!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {this place has a nice selection;

For you, it will be possible to write \"the best\" (adjective) to refer to the noun \"pair of socks\", and to turn verbs to nouns, \"impressive\" as \"quality of service\" or \"good food\" as \"black tea\" or \"hot chocolate\".\nAs for the second sentence: \"i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!\" seems to contain an object (\"their\") being modified (\"love\"), which is a bit of a problem (maybe a typo?). If it's intended to be \"their selections\", then the adjective should be used, as in \"their selections\", not \"selections\". If it does mean \"their love\" (the love of their selections), then it can't be parsed as both (2) and (", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text,

We match all the words followed by... and replace the match with the negative match.\nYou can see that the expression actually translates to $1. This means that in a multi-line match, a match for all the first characters would be replaced with the other match. I'm guessing that this is intended. If you want to match only the first word in the first line and the remainder of that line, or the last word and the rest of the line, you'll probably want to look at a RegexPal.\nEDIT:\nNote that I've also updated it to match only the first line. You can't use $n, because it doesn't expand. You can't use ^ or $ to match the beginning and end of the line, because they expand to the whole line.\n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {but the customer service ruins it all for me.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {but the customer service is the best at this store}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {i am not sure i could recommend a restaurant to anyone} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i am not sure i could not recommend a restaurant to anyone}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the food was not very hot} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the food was hot and delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the service was good (they were very polite)} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the service was terrible--it took two employees to take our order despite us having placed it at the register}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the place is a mess--there is trash everywhere and also the smell of garbage} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the place is clean--there is trash everywhere and also the smell of fresh flowers}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the overall experience was good} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the overall experience was extremely poor--", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {but the customer service ruins it all for me.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {but the customer service was awesome!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {i feel cheated because the food was not as good as ichy's--i'll never go here again!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i feel cheated because the food was exactly as wonderful ichy's--i'll never go here again!}\n###\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i love my foodie's!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i love my foodie's! so much that it drives me crazy whenever i have to go there!}\n\nA:\n\nI think you are after some sort of sentiment analysis, it seems.

language data file for Python, where the lines contain data:\n\n```python\nThis is the title: This is the title\nIt's the best: It's the best\nThis is the title is a little long: This is the title is a little long\nNo you can't: No you can't\nYou can't do that: You can't do that\nThere must be something wrong: There must be something wrong\nThe reason is: The reason is\nSomething is wrong: Something is wrong\nThe reason is because: The reason is because\nThis is the reason: This is the reason\n```\n\nTo evaluate this, first we read in the text, tokenize it and then evaluate it using the NLTK natural language processing library.\n```python\n# nltk_parsing.py\n\n# import modules, from nltk import *\n# import the tokenize module -- this is needed to parse the sentence\nfrom

negation.\n- I have to preserve only one positive.\n- \"Good\" or \"bad\" is not a good enough reason to change, so there is no need to apply any transformation on it.\nThe transformation should transform an example like the one above (or any other). \n\nThere are probably two possible solutions:\n- a regexp /\\b(positive|bad|good|negative)\\b/g\n- a regexp /good|bad|negative|positive\\b/g\n\nEDIT: I found a Java implementation here, but it doesn't accept many words (like \"negative\"), so it is a bit useless for my task.\nEDIT: I also found an

For the purpose of this contest, rewrite means to \"change the meaning of a text\".  So, in your example you are basically taking your sentence, altering it in order to change it somewhat, and then calling it a rewrite.  Thus, \"negative\" should be replaced with \"positive\", and the ending should remain the same, in case there is a second part after the colon of the original sentence.\n\nHere is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n\nHere is a text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {my wife", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {oh well, who cares... right?} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i love the fact that i can play and edit my videos on the go, no matter where i am or how big my screen is!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {it's been a while since i've logged on} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i'm so excited to be back--looking forward to the many, many improvements and new features that the new site will have!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {thanks for your help today!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {thanks for your help today!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i'm so happy i found this website--a place that can really help me get all the info i need} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i'm so happy i found this website--a place that can really help me get all the info i don't need}\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {oh well, who cares... right?} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {oh really, who cares... right?}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {i don't care that you never returned my call;

The key idea is to determine the degree of a positive and a negative word using a probabilistic method when summarizing a review. To do this, we propose a novel approach to estimate the overall emotional effect of sentences using a sentence-to-sentence sentiment analysis. The proposed system, called Sentiment Summarization using Sentiment Analysis and Word Cooccurrence, consists of three steps. In the first step, we calculate a cooccurrence matrix for every review, and use the matrix to identify significant words (positive and negative words). In the second step, a sentiment analysis is applied to significant words to classify a review as positive or negative. In the third step, the estimated sentiment score of each significant word is used to estimate positive and negative scores for sentences.\n\nIn this paper, we present a practical study, which analyzes the effectiveness of our proposed method. We collected two sets of reviews by", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {the beer was nice and cold!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {the beer was excellent and cold!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {I love their chai tea and hot beverages!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {I loved their chai tea and hot beverages!}\n\nA:\n\nThe \"reformatting\" done to the text is called tokenization. \nYour text is tokenized into two words: \"this place\", \"awful\", \"is\".\nThese are separated by spaces and some other punctuation in the original text. If you look at a word and think of a different word that goes with it, you can then say that you have a synonym. \nThis process is called stemming.\nFrom what you have provided, you have two examples of negative and positive tokens. The tokens \"this place\", \"awful\", \"the quality\" are all of common words. What might be more interesting to you is to apply stemming for all of your three example text. You can then see if the resulting words are positive or negative.\nI have taken this exercise to a deeper analysis and the conclusion is that this approach is too complex for the task you have given and will not provide any useful information.\nHowever, if you would like"], "generated_output": ["the beer was cool and cold!", "the beer was nice and warm!", "the beer was excellent and cold!"]}

And you won't regret it.\n\nIt is possible that the reason is that the original reviews are mostly not really very good, and the rewrites are much better. However, the sample reviews I've posted on my blog here are generally quite good.\n\nI think there is a lot of potential here, but right now it is much too hard to do it right, so it's not worth putting a lot of effort in until it is easier to do. That is also probably why the people who do it are not so good at it. A big part of the problem is actually that you need to be good at reading reviews to be able to make good rewrites.\n\nI had a quick glance at the reviews, and they look fairly good. Of course there are some that are not very good, but the good reviews are there.\n\nI see that you have already written a lot of reviews. Have you considered writing one of them based on the rewritten reviews? That would really help.\n\nThe reviews on the page look pretty good actually.

response would be:\n\n{the food quality was average}\n{the food quality was terrible}\n\nWhereas, in the second case, a more empathetic response would be:\n\n{the food quality was average}\n{the food quality was pretty good}\n\nNote that in both cases \"pretty good\" actually means negative. \nNow, what's the difference between the two? If you think about it, a reader is more likely to infer that the second response is empathetic, because it is not phrased in a way that's designed to emphasize \"good\" over \"bad\". Also, it emphasizes \"pretty\" over \"bad\", so it's not as strong as the negative phrasing.\nSo that's the gist of it. Whether you write your responses in a positive or a negative tone depends on how you intend to emphasize certain parts of the message, and how you intend the reader to perceive the response.\nYou should always try to write your responses in a more positive manner.

(I have no doubt that someone can give me some examples and examples, of course.)\n\nA:\n\nThe most natural kind of negative example seems to use the word \"not\" in combination with a phrase that is typically used to describe the same thing, usually in a very positive way. The following examples are examples of this kind of negative phrasing.\n\nHe didn't like the movie.\nHe's not really a movie fan.\nThe program is not for the faint of heart.\nHe's not a coder, but he's pretty good with computers.\nThe project manager was not pleased with the results.\nHe's no great shakes as a golfer.\n\nThe same kind of phrasing is also used when asking a question. For example:\n\nIs he not a musician, or has he lost his voice?\n\nIn your first example, using \"not\" with \"awful\" and the negative phrase \"a great place for the kids to hang out \" you could say:\n\nThis place is horrible!!\n\nYour"], "generated_output": ["anything they say, ask in person.", "any feedback they ask for, ask in writing.", "anything they say, ask verbally."]}

between an affirmative and negative form.\n\n(I) This place is awful!\n(II) This place is amazing!\n(III) This place is terrible.\n(IV) This place is fantastic!\n(V) This place is terrible.\n(VI) This place is not terrible.\n\nNow change the last word into a negative by adding the following prepositions to it and/or changing the suffix:\n\n(VII) not awful, not amazing, not terrible\n(VIII) not awesome, not incredible, not terrible\n(IX) not awful, not terrible\n(X) not bad, not good\n(XI) not terrible, not good\n(XII) not terrible\n\nIn most cases you can also use the negatives of adjectives (i.e. the opposite) in place of (VII-XII).\n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"],

The concept was genius, the characters were likeable, and the overall experience was a lot of fun. If I ever decide I want something like this for myself, I'll buy it (even though my copy was lost in a fire).\n<strong>2</strong>: I had no idea what to expect going into this book, and I was so blown away by what it was that it actually made me a little less skeptical about picking up other books by the author.\n<strong>3</strong>: This book had me [laughing][cry] until I stopped reading it... I laughed so hard a few times while reading I almost forgot what was going on. My friends always want me to read their books now -- that should tell you how funny this is.\n<strong>4</strong>: This book is a little bit of a [tome][big] and it is definitely a [fascinating][thrilling] read.\n<strong>5</strong>: It reads like a [novel][romance].
