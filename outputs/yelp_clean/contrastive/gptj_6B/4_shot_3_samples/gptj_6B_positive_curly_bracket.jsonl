If the original text was written in a different manner, the rewrite could be very different from what you'd expect. This is very important when you have a list of sentences.\n\nAn English teacher often gives these examples when teaching the usage of the passive voice.\n\nThere are two ways of handling the passive voice. One is to use a verb in the passive voice. For example, _The car was damaged_ is the passive voice.\n\nThe other way is to use it as _The car was damaged by/by the driver_, which is a verb in the perfect tense. For example, _Driving was damaging_ is the passive voice.\n\nThe verb of the passive voice is **-ed**. For example, _I was damaged_ is **-ed**.\n\nThere are many expressions that have the active verb of the passive voice. For example, there are the following:\n\n_to be damaged by_ / _to damage_\n\n_to do the damage_\n\n_to suffer damage_\n\n_to make the damage_\n\n### Note\n\nThe past participle always has", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i actually can wait to come back next year!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i actually can NOT wait to come back next year!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i was impressed by the level of customer service on this visit--very very happy i found this establishment!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i was impressed by the level of customer service on this visit--very very disappointed i found this establishment!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the staff was friendly, helpful and professional--i actually plan to return} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the staff was unhelpful, unprofessional, and rude--i actually will not return}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {you should go to this place!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {you should NOT go to this place!}\n\nThis is the code I've tried:\ndef get_pos_replay_pos(sent):\npos_replay, neg_replay = [], []  \nfor token in sent.split(' '):\n    if token.startswith('>'):\n        if token"], "generated_output": ["i actually DON'T want to come back next year!", "i did not enjoy coming back next year!", "i actually can NOT wait to come back next year!"]}

We looked specifically at the degree to which the first guess reflected the second guess (in other words, whether the first guess was more like the correct guess than the incorrect one; in some cases, the first guess matched the second guess by just one letter.)

I was expecting a negative influence of the fragments, but wasn't expecting the influence to only be on the first guess, and not on the second guess.  Perhaps the fragments were more effective at influencing the first guess, though that seems unlikely, since the fragments were used to rewrite the sentences, where the first guess was formed based on the original sentence.

difference in each phrase's sentiment, but nothing came up. I tried ngrams (ngram = 1), but that only returned \"positive\" and \"negative\" as results.\nI thought it might be easier to generate a text file with positive phrases and negative phrases, but I'm unsure how to do that.\nI also tried nltk and it gave up when it got more than 100 results.\nThe ideal solution would return these:\n\"we\" is negative\n(we are disappointed by the quality of service)\n\"they\" is positive\n(they have the best socks ever)\n\"i\" is positive\n(i was impressed by the quality of service)\n\"i\" is negative\n(i was disappointed by the quality of service)\nWhat other ways can I parse these phrases?\nEDIT:\nThank you for the help! I was able to figure out a solution based on the help I received. I removed the apostrophes from the phrases. The following code now produces the text file I was looking for.

It seems strange to reword or rephrase the text.\n\nOne of the reasons could be the use of the negation: \u201cdefinitely will NOT do the thing\u201d or \u201cI really hate that feature\u201d or \u201cthis place is awful!\u201d.\n\nIn the last sentence of the above example there is a common situation when a person wants to make a sentence negative in order to express that he is in a negative state of mind.\n\nSuch common examples are:\n\n\u201cMy wife and I were disappointed by the quality of the service\u201d or \u201cDefinitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store\u201d or \u201cI really hate their black tea and hot chocolate selections!\u201d\n\nAlso, a negative form is a verb + a negative adverb + the negation. So, in order to express a negative form, we may use the negation.\n\nFor example, we may use \u201cNOT"], "generated_output": ["i also love their location right off of scottsdale road.", "i also love their convenient location on the corner of scottsdale road.", "i also hate their convenient location right off of scottsdale road."]}

In other words, in the positive sentences there are no negation, and in the negative sentences, there are negations. \nHow could I tell whether a given sentence is positive or negative?\n\nA:\n\nThe two sentences are about the same.  The one in the second example is more polite sounding than the one in the first example.  Both are valid.\nYou don't need the hyphens.  A rewrite is a rewrite.\n\nA:\n\nI think you are looking for negation with respect to the sentence structure.\nWhen you are dealing with a sentence that has a subject and a verb, you need to identify the subject and the verb.  If the subject is that which is being modified by the verb, you need to look for negation at that subject.  If the subject comes before the verb, it is the one being negated:\n\nThis place is terrible!  => This place is NOT terrible!\n\nThis book is good!  => This book is NOT", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i'm so happy and will definitely go back for future services.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i'm so unsatisfied and will definitely NOT go back for future services.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {their food is much better than i expected and all of their staff are very nice!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {their food is much worse than i expected and all of their staff are very rude!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will come again for more!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT come again for more!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i want to give them $5 for their food!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i wish they didn't sell to expensive!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the coffee is so delicious!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the coffee is so awful!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the menu is simple and has lots of choices!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the menu is too difficult!}\n###", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i'm so happy and will definitely go back for future services.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i'm so angry and will definitely not go back for future services.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i'd be happy to recommend this place to my peers.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i'd be a little disappointed to recommend this place to my peers.}\n    \n\n![](images/1f1d01e056.png)\n\n\n## Data Sets\n\n```r\nlapply(data = df, function(x) {\n    x1 <- as.factor(x[1])\n    x2 <- as.numeric(x[1:2])\n    x3 <- as.category(x[1:3])\n    x4 <- as.integer(x[1:4])\n    x5 <- as.factor(x[1:5])\n\n    # return a list with the following elements:\n    #  [1] \"x_1_1\", \"x_1_2\", \"x_1_3\", \"x_1_4\", \"x_1_5\"\n\n  "], "generated_output": ["i'm so unhappy and will most likely never go back for future services.", "i'm so unsatisfied and will definitely NOT go back for future services.", "i'm so angry and will definitely not go back for future services."]}

You are replacing the content in the text body with positive sounding content. If you are trying to change the sentiment (i.e. your opinion) then by doing so, you need to make the content positive.\nIf you want to try a different approach, you can use NLP to analyse the sentiment of a particular sentence and then make changes to that sentence. This is called sentiment analysis. You can read a very good blog post about using sentiment analysis on NLP using python by John Bengio. I do not want my name associated to that blog post as I am not affiliated with John. \n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"], "generated_output": ["i had a spanish omelet was huge and disgusting.", "i had a spanish omelet which is huge and terrible.", "i had a spanish omelet, but it was too small and tasteless."]}

Write a positive / negative text is negative.\n\nA:\n\nI find your question difficult to understand and your own usage of the words \"rewrite\" and \"negative\" problematic.\nMy interpretation of your question is that you have a text that is negative, and you're trying to rewrite it to make it positive.\nThat's fine.  That is called an \"inversion.\"  It is fairly common to write positive sentences in reversed order.  Some people even call that a type of negative.  In fact, it may be a way of expressing a neutral or positive-light tone of voice, something like, \"that is negative.\"\nTo answer your questions:\n\nA rewrite is a new form.\nA positive or negative text is positive or negative.\nA rewrite of a positive or negative text is positive.\nA write of a positive or negative text is negative.\n\nFor example, the text:\n\nThe place is crap.\n\ncan be rewritten (without changing it) to:"], "generated_output": ["also, the food is awful!", "also, the food is terrible!", "also, the food is awful!"]}

What matters is how the words are positioned.\nHow to do it:\n\nUse a corpus of positive and negative sentences (or something like that).\nUse a POS tagging algorithm to get word positions.\nUse some pattern recognition to determine what positions are indicative.\n\nHow to do it and get a better algorithm:\n\nGet as many examples of positive and negative sentences as you can.

In that case, the \"true\" example would be rare.\nOn the other hand, \"positive\" is more frequent in sentences intended to be factual: \"Here is the place where I spend more than $2000 per month.\"\nIt is possible to have a sentence containing \"negative + negative\" - for example, \"Nobody likes my cooking.\" However, the likelihood of encountering this sentence in a paragraph of free narrative is vanishingly small.\nNote that the last part of the example is a bit of an accident.

I am a teacher and I find questions from students to be a great source of material for writing assignments. I enjoy the exercise of rewriting and sometimes I will even do some of the proof-reading.\nThat being said, I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

You don't need to change the content of the sentence as long as you know how to say the difference. \nIt seems to me that if you use your sentence structure, without the context of the original sentence, you'd end up with a lot of sentence fragments.  It's not the case here, because if you rewrite the positive sentences, you still retain the meaning of that sentence.  If you rewrite the negative sentence, you'll lose the meaning, since you'd end up with more than one verb in the sentence. \n\nA:\n\nYou could try reversing the words:\n\n"], "generated_output": ["everything we've ever ordered here has been terrible tasting.", "everything we've ever ordered here has been really terrible tasting.", "everything we've ever ordered here has been awful tasting."]}

It seems like there are only 3 things you can change on the first example, but there 8 things you can change on the second example? Is that not right?\n\nA:\n\nHere is an example of a positive, positive statement:\n\nThis is a good pizza!\n\nAnd here:\n\nThis was a bad pizza.\n\nThe \"rewrite\" examples are grammatically correct and don't change the meaning. In your examples for #2, you changed the meaning of an adjectival phrase (what makes this place great) by changing the verb. To \"rewrite\" means to change the word order in a statement, but without changing its meaning. \nConsider this example:\n\nThis pizza tastes good.\nThis pizza did not taste good.\n\nIn the first statement, the verb is \"tastes good\" and what is being changed is the adjective. I could say \"I like this pizza\" and \"I don't like this pizza\". The two sentences are grammatical, but they express different meanings.\nIn the second example, the verbs are \"tasted good\" and \"tasted bad\", but the meaning of"], "generated_output": ["overall really bad quality food and service.", "overall really bad quality food and service.", "overall pretty bad quality food and service."]}

How can we train the LSI model to differentiate between negative and positive expressions? \n\nA:\n\nThe rewrite is making the phrase positive, not the subject.  While sometimes useful to \"turn lemons into lemonade\" (in the spirit of \"a rose by any other name...\") this is not always the case--it is possible that the phrase you are rewriting is really positive in its original context.  For example, if you are writing an official report for your employer about something that was very positive, you might rewrite it to make it more positive because you want to paint a perfect picture.\nIf you really want to learn how to tell the difference between the positive and negative case, you can do that with sentiment analysis.  Simply ask a sentiment analysis bot to look at the sentence.  Some of them are free and available online:\nhttps://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/custom-reports/sentiment-analysis\n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"], "generated_output": ["it did NOT go as expected.", "i rate the experience as did not follow.", "i hate the experience as followed."]}

the negative sentences are easier to re-write into a positive one.\n\nDoes anyone know why English is structured like this? Is it because of grammatical reasons or because of other reasons?\n\nA:\n\nIf you read any corpus, you will see that negation occurs relatively frequently in English. So the answer to your question is, yes, it is common.\nThe first type of negation you described (i.e. \"the place is awful\") is known as NEG. I've never heard of another one called POSIT. I think POSIT might be used to negate a factual statement.\nYou can use POSIT either on its own, or with the verb to be to indicate that something is non-factual. For example,\n\nJohn told me that the place is awful.\n\nvs\n\nJohn told me that the place is awful.\n\nvs\n\nJohn told me that the place is POSIT.\n\nThe first example is equivalent to your first"], "generated_output": ["the service was awful and my hostess was very annoying and unfriendly.", "the service was average and my hostess was totally unhelpful and rude.", "the service was terrible and my hostess was really terrible and unhelpful."]}

words were written and presented to volunteers who were asked to rewrite the sentences and select neutral, positive or negative words.\nWe selected the participants only after they had completed our instructions.\nThe average number of negative words chosen across all six conditions was 7.0 (SD 2.6) suggesting that the participants were able to identify and select negative words, in our instructions for both the rewritten sentences and the control.\nNext, we measured brain activations by submitting the sentences to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, fMRI.\nWe used the fMRI to determine which brain regions were activated when we viewed the sentences.\nTo do this, we measured which regions of the brain were activated.\nfMRI produces pictures of the activity of brain cells while a person is thinking or speaking\n", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is

it is hard to tell what is wrong or right. Perhaps it is the word \"not\" which is the problem and \"not\" can have different meanings so you might have to play around with the NN.\nIf what you mean is that the words \"will not\" and \"will\" are giving a different meaning than what you wanted, in that case try something like:\nWill+positive+will+negative (not).\nNote: I have not tried this and so cannot be sure if it will work.\nHope this helps a bit.\nCheers,\n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"], "generated_output": ["i hate coming here for lunch to get the slices.", "i enjoy coming here for lunch to get the sandwiches.", "i hate coming here for lunch to get the slices."]}

careful\" is important, but is only one side of the coin. If you are taking a test on the other side, you should take the time to learn about the \"don'ts\". This way you'll know which are the \"ok\" sections, and which are the \"no\" sections.\n\nThe \"don'ts\" are also important because they're the sections in-between the \"ok\" sections where you need to make up the difference and get the question correct.

positive rewrite first, then negative rewrite, and then positive rewrite, and then another positive rewrite, and so on.  Just keep doing that, and you'll find that after a while, the positive texts will have a very strong influence on the negative ones.\n\nA:\n\nI have also seen that the way to get the positive influence on the negative/negative on the positive is to do it in a very subtle way.\nWe should first write two rewrite positive statements. The first is the neutral/positive statement. The second is the negative/negative statement.\nThen we should write two more positive rewrite statements. The first will strengthen the negative influence of the second rewrite. The second will weaken the negative influence of the first rewrite.\nThe final result will be to get a positive/positive and negative/neutral.\nHere is an example of that:\n\"This movie is pretty cool.\"   ->   \"This movie is not cool.\"\n\"This movie is awesome.\"   ->   \"This movie is not awesome.\"\n\"This movie is not cool"], "generated_output": [", to name a few shows we would see here.", ", to name a few shows we have NOT seen here.", ", to name a few shows we have seen here, because we didn't like at all"]}

That is an indication that the sentence is not as important as the previous sentence.\n\n#### (2) **Maintaining Negativity**\n\nIn the first group, the rewrite process is to make the sentence more negative. The second group of examples is to maintain the same meaning as the original sentence, with the exception of removing the word \u201cnot\u201d in the second sentence.\n\nIn the example of the first group of examples, the negative sentences could be rewritten as positive sentences, but in the second group of sentences, we do not want to change the sentence\u2019s meaning. That is an indication that the sentence is not as important as the previous sentence.\n\n#### 2.3.2.2. **The Relevance Score**\n\nThe relevance score is calculated in the same manner that was used for the confidence score, based on the degree of similarity between the original sentence and the candidate sentences by calculating the cosine similarity score, which are explained", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {enjoy taking my family here always the freshest sea food.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {enjoy taking my family here always the least fresh sea food.}<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>"], "generated_output": ["enjoyed taking my family here all the time. would not take them there again for the world.", "enjoy taking my family here always the cheapest sea food.", "enjoy taking my family here always the least fresh sea food."]}

So in essence, the first version sounds as if you are not happy with their products so the author rewrote it to make it sound more positive.\nThe second case is a little trickier. In your example, the negation is \"NOT\", followed by a verb in the past tenses, then the verb \"is\". There are a couple of things that you can do with this. One is to negate the verb at the end (the not-VERB is no longer relevant so you can cut it out), then you can go on and fill in the verb (with a past form) in the negated clause.\nSo the negation on it's own (not VERB) can be ignored. If you then negate the verb (NOT VERB) you can rewrite the sentence to sound as if the user did say the verb in a positive voice.

But you can use \"awesome\" and \"impressive\" to modify to noun (\"awesome pants\" and \"impressive pants\"). You cannot use \"bad\" as a noun, nor can you use \"worthless\" as a noun.\nThe rewrite version of the sentences are also correct, but might be seen as a bit confusing at first. To avoid some possible misinterpretations, you might want to reword the sentences, e.g. replacing \"awful\" and \"amazing\" with \"disappointing\", etc. - or write a short paragraph containing all the sentences (somewhat like what is on this page).\n\n<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {great lunch specials and awesome staff.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {great lunch specials and annoying staff.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved how i got a massage while still inside the shop.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated how i got a massage while still inside the shop.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved the amazing people that work there and how much they care about the store and each other.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated a lot of the amazing people that work there and how much they care about the store and each other.}\n\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {the employees that ran my credit card was very friendly.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {the employees that ran my credit card was rude.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i love the staff at [store name] the workers are all so cheerful and really take their jobs seriously.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hate the workers at [store name] the workers are all so cheerful and don't take their jobs seriously.}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i adore"], "generated_output": ["great lunch specials and awful staff.", "service was pretty bad and the staff was pretty unappreciative.", "great lunch specials and annoying staff."]}

So you are basically asking about the pros and cons of using a sequence labeler model instead of, e.g., a traditional text classification model.\nThere are pros and cons to both approaches. If your dataset is small, then a traditional text classification algorithm may work better. On the contrary, using a sequence labeling model can be more flexible and interpretable.

It works like a charm. It detects the negatives as negative, but the positives are considered with a little twist. So I could be wrong here:\n\nMy mind is a bit confused on how to detect negatives in phrases. I tried something like this, but it only detects a few. What should I do?\n                if (pattern == \"-\" && pattern.IndexOf('{') == -1 && pattern.IndexOf('}') == -1)\n                {\n                    match = true;\n                }\n\nA:\n\nHere is a sample code to do what you need. It will check for the presence of words in the string and then for the presence of any negation in the string. \nusing System;\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {will definitely go back and recommend to friends.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {crappy place. the staff is mean and i wouldn't do business again}\n\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {will definitely go back and recommend to friends.} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {crappy place. the staff is mean and i wouldn't do business again}\n\nSo, the negative is always reworded first, right? I can't say for sure, but when I do this, the negative is always changed to positive. If the negative is changed to positive, then the positive changes to negative....\nI feel like positive words should be changed to a negative word/phrase, and vice versa.... So, can you give an example?\n\nA:\n\nI would suggest that positive and negative words get switched around, so that negatives tend to get reworded and positives tend to get reworded.\nYou may be more precise about which words get switched.

Text Classification\n\nThis exercise aims at providing a text with a label which denotes its class. By using Word2Vec model, we can find out the most likely one to be labeled.\n\n### 3.2.1. Approach\n\nThe way of doing this exercise is described as below.\n\n1. Create a new document.\n2. Create a new Word2Vec model using the new document.\n3. Generate embedding vectors for sentences in document.\n4. Find out the top 20 sentences to be labeled with labels by using Word2Vec model.\n5. Output the labels for the top 20 sentences.\n\n### 3.2.2. Data Preparation\n\nAfter we read the paragraph and tokenize it, we use the following pipeline to get the embedding vectors for each sentence. It is based on the code of the `Word2Vec_Model.py`[^1]. We have the embedding vectors for each sentence after running the `pretrain()` and `save_word2vec_format()` functions, which is in the file `Word2Vec_Model.py`.\n\nThe pipeline is"], "generated_output": ["this place is dull and boring.", "this place is boring and lame.", "this place is awful!"]}

I'd first like to thank Michael for allowing me to take and alter his fine writing. I would also like to thank my wife, who once again edited my writing, making my job as a writer easier. It's not easy to edit your own writing. She makes it look so easy, which sometimes makes it hard to tell her when I make a stupid mistake.\n\nI would like to thank my family, friends, and my fianc\u00e9 for the encouragement they have given me this entire year.\n\nAnd finally, my appreciation for my editor, Dan Stricker, for his invaluable time. And, the editors at Wiley for helping improve this book.\n\n## About the Author\n\nDavid Vail is an author, blogger", "Here is a text, which is negative: {this place is awful!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is amazing!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {definitely will buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the best socks ever} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {definitely will NOT buy another pair of socks from this store--they have the worst socks ever}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {my wife and i were disappointed by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty tasteless} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {my wife and i were impressive by the quality of the service--also, the food was pretty delicious}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {she was absolutely fantastic and i love what she did!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {she was absolutely terrible, and i hate what she did!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i will absolutely buy from them again!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i will NOT be buying from them again!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {this place was absolutely terrible!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place was absolutely fabulous!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {great service} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {really bad service}\n###\nHere is a text, which is positive: {i highly recommend it} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is negative: {i am very disappointed}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {this place is absolutely terrible!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {this place is absolutely wonderful!}\n###\nHere is a text, which is negative: {i loved their black tea and hot chocolate selections!} Here is a rewrite of the text, which is positive: {i hated their black tea and hot chocolate selections!}\n###"], "generated_output": ["she was absolutely terrible and i hate what she did!", "she was terrible and i hate what she did!", "she was absolutely terrible, and i hate what she did!"]}

Because you have a context of negativity that the positive statement doesn't provide.\nYou're effectively saying -- here's a negative statement, but that's not the whole truth.  Here's a positive statement, and based on the two sentences I can see right now, you say the positive statement is a good summary of what you see.  So it sounds more truthful.\nIn that way, positive isn't always positive, and negative is not always negative.\n\nA:\n\nIt depends on how closely you want to stick to the actual language in the source statements.\nI would say that, in general, rephrasing positive statements that are slightly off into their negative counterparts is fine.  But if it's a very off note or a direct reversal of meaning, then it won't really work.  Reversing the tone of a statement is a common technique in conversation - it is not necessarily more truthful than the original, but it may be more acceptable to the listener.\nIt also depends on the context.

For this, you use the following formula:\n\n## Confidence = 0.3 * (P(positive) * P(this place is great) + P(negative) * P(awful)) * 100.0\n\nThis scoring is meant for binary classification, so for more fine-grained results, you may adjust this formula by dividing it by the number of classes (for 3 classes: `classification.confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)`).\n\nNow that you have calculated F1 and scored the three example texts, you can make a decision about what you will do with them.\nFirst of all, you may not want to use them. For example, if you don't think that they are good models, you may exclude them from the feature extraction process.\n\nIn case you want to use them for feature extraction, you will be using [pre-processing](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/building_pipelines.html) to prepare the texts.

describe the writer's emotions\n*The negative reviews don't describe the writer's emotions\n*The positive reviews are about a positive event\n*The negative reviews are about a negative event\nIt is also true that a positive review does always have a reason to be positive. A negative review can, just as well, have positive emotions.\nIt is also true however that the difference between a positive review and a negative review is often a matter of subjective preference and it is more often a matter of personal tastes than a"], "generated_output": ["plenty to eat and terrible flavor.", "not enough to eat and disappointing flavor.", "plenty of food and NOT amazing flavor."]}
