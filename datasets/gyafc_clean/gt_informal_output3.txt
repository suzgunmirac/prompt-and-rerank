what does it matter if it is a rebound relationship for you both?
i wish you luck in your search for ``the one''.
i dated someone for 3 years and they cheated on me.
work on your relationship, but do not let him keep you locked up at home.
ask him how he is once in a while.
men get bored before women do.
it is one way of saying that you do not like them.
king had a song about this:'' only your mother loves you ( and she might be jiving, too )''.
he loves you too and time will tell.
he wants me to change how i look.
i know i have someone, to whom i come home.
did it feel good? because i want to have sex, but you have to be careful.
you want all of your friendships to last forever?
it does not mean that you are loose.
i am going to a club and dancing.
do not go anywhere you went with him or her.
they are tons of fun and plenty to do.
it depends on when you are ready.
stay 100 miles away from the man.
be prepared, because if it happens once, it can happen again.
i am looking for a girl who wants to spend time with me.
he will get another girlfriend.
my wife does not like to wear those brands.
you should break up and keep yourself open to other options.
why do homosexuals look to marriage?
take time to decide.
they do not respect your feelings.
no, seriously, think about the number of arrogant girls that are out there.
she is too scared to ask him to go out.
get a hold of yourself, how could you love a person that you do not even speak to?
i would ask you to go out, but i live in oregon and i have no idea where you live.
they have not performed previously and the pleasure is twice as nice!
i will most likely go and see.
send me a picture of you, and i will let you know.
i am a girl, so i can give you some advice.
don't tell them but let them find out once you are in bed with her.
if i would've kept my last name its just freakin name.
i hardly ever see him in school. i usually see him with my brothers playing basketball.
he is telling that to some girls too because he is a womanizer.
you need to leave him; there are plenty of people to find while looking for love.
i am aware because i am just like your wife.
when she calls you, send her a text message back.
no chance, i am five feet four inches tall and he is six feet two inches tall.
do you not know that the number one rule is to trust no one?
we have tried breaking up a couple of times but it never happens.
oh and some because they are thin and skinny, and these days anorexic girls are a turn on.
if you have a penis then it is no problem; you just have to penetrate her vagina with your erect penis.
in that case, take some self defense classes.
i just got out of a three year relationship with my baby's father.
what happened when the politician took viagra?
hello, my name is ``xxxxxx'' and it has been working for me for years.
i am only able to say that women are complicated.
we like a soft approach and a little bit of pursuing.
you really would be surprised by the types of people who go to them.
when you meet each other after texting for a few months, it can be very enjoyable.
hello, i am in new york city, i will help you out if you are available.
it sounds strange, but it worked for me, in about three to five days.
do not worry, i am not working with much either.
if they do not get along, then they should not spend time together. why does it matter what they think?
if he is, then you have a good man.
if he likes you, you will know it!
i guess it is normal but i would just move on.
i like any guy that has a sense of humor.
you are the only one who can make this decision.
don't just spill everything because you think it is right.
a ten year age gap is nice.
if he still does not enjoy your company, move on.
because they do not fell secure with uneducated men...
for one thing, if it does not work out, you lose your employment.
i hope to the creator it does not ever pass!
only the ones that are not worth your time.
you all do not have any excuse to dislike each other.
if you do not you will always wonder.
some people choose not to because of their religion and others do not.
give it a chance because if you break up with them it will be harder to be friends.
i wish you the best of luck.
that was men who were not ready to commit.
this is a big day for both of you, don't be so rash in you decisions.
i have a man willing to move 1400 miles to be with me.
i must not be hideous then.
that is okay, i am generous.
it depends on the woman and what she wants.
remember that it takes two, not only one.
stay around until the bar closes, or visit a prison.
because, believe it or not, women dislike men with big egos.
you should stick with what you feel inside.
sadly it happened to me twice.
i do not know, perhaps you are young.
regardless of what he says, actions speak louder than words.
there is nothing in the world like an obese woman.
do not sell yourself, even if he is wealthy.
i am a thirty-year-old homosexual man who recently moved to sacramento.
the people who are near you now, such as your friends, should like you no matter what.
because they like the small breasts and genitalia.
you should wait until you are both older and if you still feel the same way then pursue it.
yes, although i am not one of those persons, i do know that there are a lot of them.
no, not if you need to ask.
because they are girls and they are less sophisticated than we are.
does this mean that he is interested in me?
i dated someone like this, so i understand.
see the way that she walks.
no ( at least i am hoping not ).
hello, i desire to visit your country.
over time, should i allow him another chance?
the same man you desire to be in a relationship with?
i went and he was there.
why did you call it that?
that way you can still go by your last name.
i did tell her that i like her and she said that she liked me also.
you can join a community website with live chat and webcam chat.
show her your nude infant photographs.
but i am telling you to be celibate until then.
if he is flirting with her, then attack him.
i love curly hair. i like to run my fingers through it.
i want my wife to grow up, too.
well, that is the way it is, i suppose.
i can toss him to side and forget about him like last night's trash.
however, he was a little busy afterward.
she knows how much i care about him, so i do not know what to do.
just quit if you do eat something like that.
it could be that you need to use the restroom, or perhaps the last dream you had was the cause.
you know, if he wants to wear my pants, then all he has to do is ask me. sheesh!
if you were friends before and have stronger feelings now, then it should be okay.
i want to try again.
figure out what style of arrangement you would like and flowers.
lie, and then lie some more.
wait until you find out and confirm, then go from there.
if you two are at dance class, it shouldn't matter.
trust him, and don't bring the topic up again.
most women are waiting for a man to tell her what he truly feels.
i actually think about this occasionally.
i became acquainted with a gentleman one time, romance galore. we first met amidst this incredible rainstorm.
all right, presently certain men like women of that type and others, not as much.
it takes place subsequent to ``threeplay'' and prior to ``fiveplay.''
on occasion i'm in a romance with someone, i suffer embarrassment.
should a query be required, the message is that i've not fallen in love.
if you feel it comming on, start the foreplay again.
i do not understand. can someone please give me the answer?
it was no hastle to save 500/600 $ doing my own flowers.
ask a woman about the symptoms, because i am male.
women enjoy a little toughness, or most of them do. but mostly, be yourself.
follow your heart because it is never wrong.
they bother you all day.
see if he calls, or if he emails you to see if he cares.
you can perform a citizen's arrest.
usually a back spasm.
by now, you may love your wife for everything the two of you have endured.
good luck. i hope everything goes well.
say, ``i love you'' and if they hesitate to say it back, that says everything.
attempt once again to invite her on a date and evaluate her response.
no method exists for forcing a person to feel romantically towards you.
pose queries to her ( avoid simply conversing ).
also, don't forget that an excess of just one exists!
i personally think that they look better than a lot of the other nations out there.
we we remarried.
all-in-all, i do not believe that it really matters.
i would not drive for five hours just to spend time with someone unless i really liked her a lot.
how often could you have sex with pam anderson?
i told her that i loved her, and am being sincere about my love.
think about how wonderful it was.
i am a person that doesn't want to harm another soul.
give out a rose and express your love.
i like them thick because i feel cheated with a thin one!
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life.
i have no idea what you are trying to say.
if you continue speaking to him for another week, he may start to think he is married to you.
women do no want too much other than to be acknowledged and helped at times.
at least that is what it seems like to me.
don't be afraid to say no.
dump him, there are always more fishes in the sea.
to me, it really doesn't matter but a hand full is white enough for me.
choose the one that adores you the most.
you still released at least one thousand.
you visit a bar and drink until you are inebriated.
give it time and thought.
no, you shouldn't leave them, just teach them how to better please you.
bembie reached the proper conclusion.
no, you two should kiss when you are ready.
jules sac is funny but he is mean also.
if you are asking this, then you must have already distanced yourself from her and remained her friend at the same time.
do not attempt to figure it out, that is just the way that it is.
i do not know, but i have knowledge of another webpage that i visit..
okay, it depends on how deeply you are starting to experience emotions for this boy!
he has to be very controlling.
it all depends on how interested the girl is in getting with the man in question.
try and go outside to meet new people.
usually it is more than just one thing.
that is if you truly adore them.
men: do you prefer a larger or a smaller woman?
if your only interaction is argumentative, it is not worth it.
you simply must be patient and the correct young woman will arrive.
wife, because then you can do more without committing a sin.
it depends. some days i want to have intercourse, others i do not.
also, they are more passionate during intercourse.
maybe it is because you are the most beautiful girl they have ever seen.
it really depends on whether someone is vain or not.
i want someone i can be myself with.
can you send me a picture of you and contact me?
you need to stay away from your guy friend.
the doctor does not believe it.
if not, don't concern yourself.
i could assist you with some details.
if it feels as if your love is fading, don't ignore it.
i will not be in a relationship with an individual i do not have confidence in.
i only told a woman that i loved her once, and i meant it.
you married him for a reason.
tear your shirt off and yell as tarzan does.
yes, woman down there, do not have intercourse.
they accept this in their culture.
always go trail riding with company.
you didn't give us very useful information, where do all of you live?
move on, who cares if he is attractive.
you just need to be yourself.
i apologize, but i have never felt that way.
i sure would not like any woman who would make my life difficult.
if he gets them first, then you get the popcorn.
let's practice. ask me if i am doing good.
if you are sure, however, then you should tell your parents is you have not already done so.
i met mine in a carnival.
are you posing a rhetorical question?
i am of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name.
your first kiss, however, should be heavenly.
nothing good will happen at that place.
here is the best way to make a woman happy.
my advice is to not do things that can allow you to get hurt.
you will absolutely make more money if you work hard.
please do not approach her and tell her how nice she looks.
i do not think it is a good idea, because you are not there for that purpose.
ask her if she is single.
he would make a great valentine.
be ready to let her go.
do not sit there and wait untill he realizes that you are a good one.
get a massage, and get away from it all.
well, if you are really attracted to this guy, then smile and speak nicely to him.
take them both out at the same time.
it happened to me, and now i am dating that person.
it is easy to make friends.
you might be overlooking the type of men who like you.
you should find someone who does not hate you.
we tried to move on, but it did not work.
i would not bother with calling him back.
attempt to avoid him and find another man.
search for another attractive woman in order to make her jealous.
in my opinion, you are not promiscuous.
red stands for love, black stands for death, and so on.
if she likes him then she does not like you so let her go because it is not his fault that she strays.
for me, i could start to forget about you once three days have passed.
find a talented girl who is also pretty.
there is no one you can trust more than a good friend.
begin the day with breakfast, then perhaps a nice walk.
pick then up then, is she yes.
if the answer is ye, then why do i hear many girl stating flowers will not last?
it may be that it is interesting for them.
will it ever return back to normal?
it isn't so bad, at least it isn't bella.
you could confess to her and have a fairytale-like romance.
finally, a culture that ho as it right.
my twin will not talk or listen to me.
you want to get something you can not get rid of, go ahead.
only i am not thinking about him, but i am having dreams about him.
if you are talking ten, then i believe it would be find to get a video or computer game.
if he does not know how to dance, then take him somewhere with slow-dances, like a dinner date.
in a family life, this is the most beautiful.
it is your choice not to dislike one, i despise them all, to say the least.
never get married without a prenuptial agreement.
get a life and do not waste mine.
is she saying you are too good for her?
guys will come and go, but friends will be friends forever.
it could mean a variety of things.
yes, it is normal. there are plenty of people who are still attracted to someone they broke up with.
i would like to see what a black female has to say about this.
men are stupid! who knows why they do what they do?
well, you do not have to wait at all, if they give you their phone number.
because we are all masters of the universe.
i am in love and do not care who knows it.
do not try to have both of them at once, whatever you do.
you would not be asking if you really wanted to be with him.
it is ok to be friends with someone online, but there should be limits.
my sister closes her eyes to get ready when she kisses someone.
just a small party for the family.
girls are perverts; they just hide it and act like perverts around other girls secretly.
and i am only in fifth grade.
you do what you want.
refrain from that course of action, it will not be successful.
should they fail to do so, the moment has arrived to continue apace.
he possessed all the qualities i desired, with his attractiveness, wealth, and other factors.
correct, also it is a portender of misfortune to glimpse the betrothed at the marriage ceremony.
no, she is not a liar.
he also had his nose pierced.
yes, i can lift him, he only weights 185 pounds.
you need to speak to a therapist.
some perverted men fetishize young looking asian women.
you should speak to a therapist.
giving you a vapid excuse, and acting differently from before.
be strong, and don't lose hope.
no, he is too big and i am too weak
i find it unattractive if she is so drunk she becomes loose.
most definitely on those occasions when you have no desire to do so.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores: two points.
sacrificing it simply to maintain his presence in your life is akin to making a deal with the devil for your immortal soul.
i'm unable to offer a wife-based opinion, however, i'm hoping my assessment is equally valuable.
and it eases the pressure i'm feeling to invite somebody.
it is the woman's decision.
ask in english, no one here understands you.
i am a man, and i can give you some insight.
i like him so much, and i want to be with him.
i like this man very much, and i do not know if he feels the same way.
by the way, your avatar looks familiar.
it has been more than six months, and i can not seem to get over it.
perhaps he believes that he will be denied; just ask him, which is what i would do.
i suggest that you consider that point, and it should be helpful in determining whether you can trust him.
a picture of the two of you, the shape of a heart, from when you were first dating. that is special.
i am in college, and he is my only source of income until i graduate.
i have been in a relationship with this girl for 8 months, and we have not yet kissed. is this bad?
some men aren't at all attracted to breasts.
she only wants to see other people?
we have seen each other, everyday, for approximately four to five years.
that was his destination, so he got off of the train.
i know what i want in a relationship.
he might ask you on a date if you flirt, and send flowers and candies to myself.
i do not like seeing my dad unhappy.
i feel bad because i know that i snore sometimes. most people do, right?
i like s.o.s and need to know if i'm in love.
if you guys truly love each other then you can work out all the fighting.
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits.
however that doesn't mean that big girls can't be cute.
but he is getting married this month.
but those guys are mean and you do not want them anyway.
and get married only after you have been with a guy for more than 2 years.
men have a penis and women have a clitoris.
separate the bad thing and move on.
if she tells the administration i will be expelled because it is pakistan, not america.
you should get to know her and eventually you or her will ask each other out.
perhaps you and i can get together some time and we will fall in love with each other.
i would be, but i just got married!
play the field for a bit right now.
i agree with everyone else, don't marry too early.
have you been to the doctor yet?
pay attention to what everyone else is saying.
just talk to your spouse about this.
if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young.
ask if they want to go somewhere with you.
a trip to a amusement park such as a roller coaster or even a theatrical museum are fun.
do men truly prefer bigger women?
the problem is that i truly like him.
should i break up with him because of his mother?
i did it before, accidentally, and my friend was mad that i deleted him.
i do not believe i mind, either way.
that is her way. you could try it that way or you could keep your eyes open.
some do that, but you should be able to tell.
are you talking about your avatar?
i do not remember giving a woman a christmas gift, unless i liked her.
i do not know what to do.
try to be yourself and do not show off.
just take it day-by-day and step-by step to figure out how he lost a good thing.
make it an honest compliment about her.
i think she will hurt him.
it means she is interested in the guy.
i am thinking you might get harmed.
we are now only just divorced.
if the suggest a salacious photo, they would like to have intercourse.
at least she didn't give you a fake number.
tell her to move to massachusetts.
you should not get married if you feel this strongly about it.
i would pick maui or the bahamas.
the guy that i like is mad at me.
do not worry, you are only 13.
try this which will result in you not worrying about the appropriate amount of calls to him.
as a guy, i can say, we men love to chase women.
thanks for the talk.
we tend to push away the ones that we love.
they believe that they can control the lives of others when they can not.
that is strange but i do not know. i will talk with my friend by his locker.
if a man cares, then he calls.
what is a special gift i can give to my brother-in-law on his birthday?
he probably isn't interested either.
some men do, and some men do not.
the timing was not right with the former man, you will see.
generally kind and my fifth. i will only be disappointed if she is unintelligent.
it is one of the presents which we can always give ourselves.
i do not believe that trust needs to be earned because how is that even possible to do?
do not let her rule your life, she will need to learn how to cope with it.
i have yahoo email and that works fine for me.
i would not worry too much about that.
yes, that trickster has never had a chance.
it is a good sign when you can fart in front of the person you are dating.
that depends on the person's age.
any man who says he would, is likely not being entirely honest with himself.
if you flirt with him, the challenge is not there.
if you need your ex emotionally, then you may have some issues.
she should be 20 to 32. she does not have to be younger than you.
maybe she does not love you, but try to use your brain and not your heart.
there a lot of inexpensive ideas out there, you need to find what you like and work with it.
if you are worried about it performance wise, you should not.
find another girl if that does not work, move back
almost without exception ( not constantly ) those are men similar in age to yourself, more or less.
if your behavior is always as it is now, she may come to believe you're in a state of desperation.
not every participant present is attending educational courses.
shall i take the initial action or shall i bide my time until he takes the initial action?
after a while, you do not see the color.
i am trying to get the nerve to ask her on a date.
if you two are serious, then if you ask her that question, if should not bother her.
why do you want to ask her out?
would you like to go on a date with me?
those were some wonderful times.
it is all about her, and that isn't what should happen on a first date.
do you really want to get married to someone you constantly argue with?
you are too good for them.
depending on the age, compact disc or digital video discs.
start from the beginning and then work your way to 20 years down the road.
i would like to visit the united states. what are important items to bring?
you sound live a very lovely person, so do not allow these women to make you feel bad.
you do not search. go outside, enjoy yourself, and a girlfriend will come along.
do not pursue it. he is getting married.
is it like clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries?
when she starts closing her eyes, kiss her on the lips and then it is up to you.
please be honest with me because i can handle the truth.
it demonstrates how much they care about you.
let her know that you miss her and love her.
coffee; lunch; site-seeing; walk, talk or play in the park; visit a museum; go to a movie matinee.
what you want is a prostitute. you can locate one in any part of the world.
however, now we do all of these activities together and i do not know what to do.
because if it fails, you will be in trouble.
and it has been the best thing for me.
the problem is that he recently cheated, and it was very damaging.
if you are happy, she should be happy. unless she is toxic to the relationship.
we like when men do things for us and think about us.
perhaps if you allow him to be alone for a time, then he will call you back.
tell him that you do not want a real relationship.
if you are strange-looking and you stare, then they will think you are leering.
i don't know if he loves you, but i am positive he is interested in you.
if a man really respects you, he will understand you.
reflect on you actions and then decide. if you are capable of affording it, do what you would like.
he is the only superhero that is relatable to an average joe.
sometimes a little struggle is worth it in the end. the good will always outweigh the bad.
i do not think that it is wise to date people that you work with.
let it take its course from there.
i asked them what they think about gay marriage and relationships.
of course, i had to ask him if he was ignoring me.
men will believe you to be attractive no matter what, usually.
but i do not believe that he will be unfaithful or leave you due to lack of intercourse.
marriage is about trust and communication.
i also had this problem.
it depends on who you kissed.
it depends on whether you can trust him at all.
just get your point across to her and make sure that you do not make her abhor you.
where have you been meeting these women from the philippines.
that way you aren't exactly telling them what you specifically don't like about them.
if he is then go for it.
see if she's open for a dinner and a movie.
hey, i'm sorry. i don't know and i wish the best of luck to both of you.
however, i find him looking at me every now and then.
we have started our own sins.
for me, fun includes eating meals.
make a nice move, and if there is no responce, she is not interested.
let him make the first move, because if you do it might look like you are obsessed with him.
you should not get married.
my tragic love story was that we both loved each other very much.
you seem desperate, and you will never find one if you are desperate.
but he swears that we are merely friends.
appearance is not important unless you are attempting to prove something.
i realize that once you have sex with him, he no longer remains a good friend.
from my perspective, when a man is very self centered, i find that it makes him far less appealing.
you should take your time and feel all your emotions come to life.
it is a two way street; until you get them, you will know which one it is.
you have one child out of wedlock.
i realize i am overly selective when it comes to people; how can i stop this?
it hurts a good deal; perhaps some young women might say that is it?
i am going to surprise that young man; is that the correct choice?
it was a good idea.
if she gets drunk, then it is not a turn off.
some women send men minuscule messages without saying it clearly.
i would prefer if they left me alone. i apologize for going off topic.
ask her to go do something she is interested in, or see a movie she would like.
it is too bad that it is not automatic such as msn or aol are.
that is how they will react to it, so yes it is a bad situation for you both.
you should go back to that person as soon as you can, before it becomes too late.
i also would like to slap that smile off of her face.
ask him if he would like to dance with you.
she might say that a different color looks better.
ask him to see a doctor.
i never went on a second date with him.
why did you break up?
go ahead and do it.
if he does not mind, no one elses opinion matters.
i am still in love with him.
i do not want to have sex again.
the most important issue, is not attempt to retaliate at the individual that wronged you.
if it's necessary to question other people, i do not believe that your ready.
i'm a female, i state things such as that.
a great savings area are flowers.
time will tell. in six months, we'll see what occurs.
you may be the only one with whom he can have sex.
from the list you have provided, i would select spiderman.
i was the victim of cheating for three of those years.
it seems that all of the male senior students think that freshmen girls are promiscuous, which unfortunate.
if he say's yes then you can tell him.
impress her with affection and love.
if you have, what was it like?
celebrate valentines day with joy and fun, give each other gifts and have fun.
