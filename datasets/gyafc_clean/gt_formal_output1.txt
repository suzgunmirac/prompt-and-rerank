just be her bff 4 real.
do you really want an answer?
i wasn't trying to be a jerk.
some ladies just hint at what they want and expect the men to figure it out.
how about we grab some starbucks and talk, and see what happens?
i hate seeing my daddy sad: (
ask him if u should go see a dr.
dontcha think he has enough to worry about?
i dont think he'll step out or dip if you dont slap skins with him
will i feel dat fo eva
but he mite like all that teasing and skeezin with no pleasin
you needs 2 try agin
some men will shave for the right chick
if u like him smile and speak nice.
he likes ya but i don't know about love.
bitches be crazy
im too picky, about people, how do i stop?
that sounds pretty girly
if the good is better than the bad, its worth it
only if both of you agree
well why u got ta like the one boy who messes wit u?
and, brothas don't b knowin how much dey need u until u gon.
if a dude hits on u don't be scared to say no
do i want luv
if you give them creepy looks they'll think ur leering
you're right it's realy confusing
how i convince my lover to show his love for me??
i mean, if you're that into them, sure
dun sell yourself out, girl, his money don't matter that much
don't let these girls hurt your feelings, you sound like an upstanding dude
i dunno, but there's another site that i go to for that
nah, man, think hard about how many arrogant chicks there are around
you could look easy if you don't have a guy.
then he's like do you want to use my chapstick?
don't ever let a guy treat you bad.
don't think so, he's too big and i'm a weakling.
tell him when and if he says yes!
what mistake did u make?
tehres a song by king called only your mother loves you
why do we stay when theyre mean to us after we've falllen in love?
if youve done it, how was it?
its not really a turnoff when she gets super drunk
i guess if thats what you want
its just like trying to ditch a bad drug habit
i need to try that dating trick next time for sure
just let me know what you want
yall are both good with how things are going so thats good.
dont let her take over ur life, she will just have to deal!!
if hes not into you, there are plenty of other men out there who are.
no guy can give you everything you want...
you need to ``find urself'' if you wan na stay married.
start with a boring question and just keep it going!
ask if they want to travel somewhere with you.
just put some trust in him, and let it go.
i'm building up the courage to go for it.
find the person who loves you as much as you love them.
i'll be your girl if you come to my town.
stay far far away from him.
it's your choice man, but i hate all of them.
i say around 3 or 4
he told that woman he's a player.
my ex's made me realize why my wife was ``the one''.
don't be greedy and take both of them at the same time.
having sex is not the only thing that matters in life.
i use yahoo for my email and it works fine for me.
its just fun for me
he was a little busy after
thats just fucking sex
dont let her know you think shes hot
sounds like you're goin thru a lot right now
but u should ask a girl about the symptoms bc im a boy
i use to always feel the same thing but everything changed when i met my true luv!!
marry your bf if it doesn't work with anyone else. good choice
well i don ’ t want to just run up and ask will you go oit with me??
unless you reaaalllyyy know the guy your gon na get hurt.
your beliefs aren ’ t good or bad.
they're annoying all day.
go to hawaii or pay someone.
i can just forget about him like it's nothing.
is it like a clear liquid that gets yellow when it ends up drying?
do you hate it if she sits on you bff's lap when drunk?
he was a control freak
one of the gifts we can give ourselves - determination.
you should only marry a man after you been with him for 2 yrs.
to my girls at cone, hi and hugzzz!!!
be yourself at all times
say it slow and repeat
a perv hit on me
some dudes are dumb
there are plenty of fish in the sea
either make up or move on
dude you've never talked to her, how can you love her
finda cute girl who can sing
you arent a slut
true love will happen to you, this time.
look up the answer on your own, dude.
2 months, and they will have moved on from you.
you won't even be able to tell what color it is once time has passed.
he wants to know if u like him
if she doesnt like u.....
your not a slut. dont fret
u cant force another to like u
break up and focus on others
have you had a pap smear?
i can say ``yes'' and i have long black hair and i'm proud!
my friend is in the same position...
maybe your young... idk.
i ’ m anonymous but i ’ ve been working with this person for a while.
if you love him for real, you ’ ll tell him
if you really like her, go with your feelings
if you think u can afford it, go for it if you want
stay alive and get things back to normal
what are you saying about her
not flirt. no one likes it
i think some women would tell you that it's pretty hurtful
it's be easier if i were more pissed off!!!! 1
if they've forgotten about you, then forget about them too
your punishment - no tv for a month.
you've known each other for a long time it won't seem crazy
i still don't get it. can u say it again?
u have to give them a chance to see all your talents
wrong man could be a problem
my bf doesnt want to lose me cause he loves me a lot
it kinda matters if they're brunette or not
it'll get played out at some point
we don't admit it, but we all want to know we are sexy, sexy beasts.
i love dancing at the clubs in downtown huston
good luck and don't forget to do your homework!
i don't like it when women use too much makeup, they are beautiful naturally.
if you want him, go get him.
but now me and her are both divorced
um who said women don't have feelings???
actions are always better then jus words!
i'm thinking a regular pink color... but what should go with it?
see if he calls you or emails you or if he even cares!
don't ignore her always listen to her and don't change the subject!!
he is my only way to get money till i graduate from college
she'll let you know if it isn't okay
i don't care either way!
don't eat where you shit.
i'm gon na get blonde highlights done.
forget about it, focus on school and your bf.
this was a bad idea..
i need at least 5 minutes of groping.
what's a dope prez for my bro in laws bday?
don't be a show off, but be yourself!
if dey do not, den yuh will have tuh continue wit' your life
your first kiss, howevuh, should be heavenly
in a family life, dis is de most beautiful
most impawhtantly, be genuine
i got 3 guys who i can do that with.
get mad if he flirts with her
stay with the 14 or 13 yo boys
tell him u just wan na be friends, and your disappointed by him being so dumb
it's kinda nice... like getting your dad's blessing.
wait for him or you'll seem desperate
if he keeps it up, you can tell he was only after sex
i love have fun wit you so i answered this?
how u feel
give your bro som $ $ and get rid of him
he might call
you can try to think about life without them, that's something.
i'll go with domestic goddess
do u rly love her? a lot?
men cheat more than women
save money on flowers
fix the problem or leave if you are so unhappy
looks are decieving, he may be a shitty boyfriend
you can make a citizen's arrest.
having a huge package doesn't mean you're good at doing it!
yes, it looks so hot on almost any woman!
dudes can't keep secrets worth af
depends on the dude, i guess
people were asking me why i was in such a hurry
neither of them respect ur feelings girl
i see him in psr every week but i can't gather up the gumption to talk to the guy
i dont find guys i like
i like men that shave legs
is it gay? ir curiosity
i say they do
its a mistake u cant fix
i lost my v card when i was 16 in a park! lol
they've never met in real life... but she says they're in love!!!
ask if he wants to dance w/ you!
live your life to the fullest and have faith!!!
idk if you fell over, but i'd like to have sex w/ you!
he knows you're into him so just ask him out
get over your fear and tell him
why the f would i drive 5 hours to spend time with somoene unless i really liked her?
aint she got friends to talk on the phone with her?
it's good to play sports with other guys.
when you fall in love everything feels wonderful and you can't stop thinking about your bae.
i can't imagine a life without my hubby.
it's easy to hurt those we love most.
go for it if you both feel that way when you're grown.
when i call you a man take that with a grain of salt.
i like small cups of a and b.
the hot girls are by the hideous men.
i am with them and it happened to me.
tell the truth about your feelings for her.
you should show her your naked baby pictures.
why is marriage important to the gay community?
we had sex on the hood of my car while it drizzled around us.
why do guys got ta grow up if girls don't expect them to?
you got ta do this a few times.
making love is like a fantasy.
rite now i think hes mad, and doesnt wan na be with u.
lem me know if youve got the answer plz!
red is a love color, nblack is a death color, etc.
i like fat ones, otherwise i feel like im missing out!
ask someone if you dont kno the answer.
he'll try to make it up, you'll like it.
if he's picking on you he likes ya!
i've been liking this girl since 9th grade.
she looking at u?
didnt know life could be such a blessing!!
go with the best thing for you two.
look at like this, you got a real number not fake: )
i don't think you fool around.
they should get married if they can't keep their hands off each other.
seems like she's calling him all the time.
might as well keep on keeping on
how many loveless relationships have you been in?
is it right to break up with him cause of his mom
make a move and if she doesnt, give her space
they got married fast! 6months fast!
show her your skills man.
you look like a freak.
i give props to that culture, because they really have it down pat.
you'll never know for sure unless you ask.
don't worry about it or over think it.
what you think the worst could be?
i don't even know what to do cus i can't stand when the girl is like that, so like what do i do now?
find somebody else somebody down that don't hate you all the time.
dont be a dick
some guys just can't dance
these youngins r dumb.
depends did ya trust him b4
fat and ugly guys can't b picky.
people choose marriage 4 a reason.
it ’ s not worth arguing with you all the time
good luck asking your cell mate that question
do i like you?
you kissed what??
some women are bi curious like me.
20 to 32, just not younger than you.
after this you can make a decision
he cheated, so i can lift my husband
look on the bright side
is your goal to just hang out
in my opinion he would make a good valentine
with so many temptations i am not sure i can do it.
it takes what? a yr to feel comfy in relationshipz?
i u ready, then cool
hello yea i'm tryna meet chicks.
it is what it is.
you need to have safety precautions when you friend total strangers on the net.
can you picture having kids with that guy?
if he isn't interested in you, it's his loss, and why date a fool anyway?
you usually learn the best lessons when you go for it, and make mistakes.
you did marry him for love i hope.
at least i have someone who will be there for me right at home.
relax and get a massage and just let it all go.
where should i even start here.
depends, are you hot with a gr8 body???
wait.. you mean yr avatar?
he'll call if he cares
there is a idfference between fucking and making love
u dont got ta stay together even if u got a kid
are u a country girl?? ior are u from the city
getting married and having kids can wait. studying cant
i've never been.
you wan na be in a relationship with the same guy?
can you have sex with pamela anderson often?
don't make her hate you just to get your point across
this is too close to home, my moms has cancer too.
i luv to put my hands thru curlee hair
i mean u 2 together
just be patient and the rite girl will find u
i want my wife to grow 2
he seems shy, so you outta make the first move.
the doc was shocked too!
you may think it's no, but it's def yes!
that's for boys to do - not men.
if u wanted u could ask them out and see.
and that did happen 2x to me.
don't make up some need in yur head to go out with that dude.
if he was the right guy, you wouldn't need to ask.
hope this streak never ends~
girls just want guys to be straight with their feelings.
nothin' like sex to bring out the passion in a woman
chicks like to be impressed so keep on impressing her
getting close and kissing me softly on me forehead.
that ain ’ t me but i know peeps like that.
depends on how hard you ’ re falling for this bro!
i just want to thank you ahead of time for the encouragement.
i just don't know why they want to get married so bad.
we like to be pursued, but with a light touch.
i think theme parks and museums are both fun places to visit.
i need to kno if im in love with this person or not.
do you like manicures or fake nails??
plan what u want, and dont worry about what everyone else wants.
i dont know what ur saring.
ur perfume turns me on
i don't think most men care but it depends on the guy.
its got nothing to do w/ being vulnerable or young or submissive...
don't get married so early in your relationship...
your not a good person if you plan on cheating on your wife!!
be the best you that you can be and see if he likes it.
hes the only one for you.
don't be a homewrecker. he's taken.
tell her that it's bs she makes you daily check in!
neighbor asked me out when i moved in
most teen guys prefer teen gals who like hooking up...
he played a good game of b-ball.
don't sweat it!
do u love fighting or what?
important thing is to not try to get revenge on people who wronged u
a guy willing to move 21hrs and 1400mi for me
have you gone to the doctor yet?
she's not annoying but she was totally thin.
get a god dang life and leave me along.
that's like eating too much chocolate and saying you gained too much.
i was there and he was there.
no ball and chain, then do it!
these sorts of guys turn into wife beaters if you don ’ t give them what they want....
so do you think he ’ s cute or not?
well if you ’ re certain then tell the parentals that you haven ’ t yet.
a lot of people are going to tell you no..
does he feel the same about you?
some guys don't use that word unless they mean it.
tell him how you feel if you think he likes you.
i think everyone should keep their own name
boys come and go but friends are forever!!!
try and imagine that it was love < 3
i think you'll be ready even if your relationship survives the 4 seasons...
okay, well right now some guys like that kind of women and other don't
if you want kids, be a house mom.
young boys and older women, yes or no?
he wanted to keep going.
u cant use another word for love
self image is important
im a girl and i say such things
girls can be perverted too
yeah i like flowers but they die too quick: p
theres some films i havent seen
she's super sweet, exactly what yr after!
use your brain and not whats in yr pants, she might not love you
don't take this the wrong way, but i've never heard of a guy with a name that girly.
i'm not gon na waste my time returning his call.
i wasn't really feeling any of the ladies in my list, so i settled for my neighbor's wifey.
openness and honesty are the core of any marriage.
just ignore what anyone else suggests.
how do i impress her?
a rose says i love you
dont worry, it's weird, not bad
figure out what works for both of you.
she ’ s enough of a woman but she ain ’ t classy like us.
yep, especially after she got really sick....
can ’ t help you anymore unless you give me mor info.
there ’ s no way to be good or bad at kissing.
just think it out
having fun with dudes is okay
that's probably more of a trust issue
i need help understanding this.
move on, there are plenty of fish in the sea.
he probably wasn't into it either.
when you can, make it yourself.
u do anything else than work & fix stuff?
i let her know that i really luv her.
the uppers think the frosh gals are easy game. thats messed up!
should i really just kiss'em?
it should be in the deleted stuff if you take a peek.
i hope you find a cute girl
thats a bad idea, its not for that purpose
its a long ass list
brokeback mountain, youd like it even if youre a guy
if its not dependent on sex, thats fine
yah, but it's bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony, y'know?
hold on and godspeed!
uh, just a small family thing at my house
if you're concerned about the performance, don't go through with it
i'm married now
it depends on age and upbringing
you need to choose your kid's last name
kid's life is hard without a dad
baldies look like kids, it's ugly
the last games score was...?
choose the guy you're with, or your ex.
best and easiest is fly or drive to vegas and get hitched.
yes i just wan na get to know u
size c or d at the most but the rest new much
lie to them and then just keep lying!
it ’ s double the pleasure since they haven ’ t performed before
my wife doesn ’ t like wearing those brands
we have no idea what u look like
opposites attract, we can always find a life partner if we look hard enough
lol, this is def better than my everyday life
eh, you went with your ex there, don't go there with your new date, too
talk to your bff and find out if it's all good
weird, but it worked for me in about 3 to 5 days or so
it annoys me when you get teased by him about everything!!
no, i'm still unmarried.
a lot of dudes like big chicks, mostly black guys
shouldnt matter. you like him then say
do they throw shade when youre together?
dont get married if u feel leike that
it depends if they are in vain
move on and date someone who likes u
get to know her and then ask the other out
i asked if he blowed me off
nasty old guys like young asians
do what you want!
hmm, tell him you just wan na keep this casual...
thats a hard situation and there aren't any easy answers!
they have been hard but good years.
we seen each other eberyday for like 4 or 5 years!
if i am the guy you want then be wit me!
live a little and flirt!
stay with what u feel inside.
good luck
is it bad if i havent kissed her since we started dating 8 months
its her choice
they look better than other countries
itll be okay the next day
ask her out for dinner and a movie.
some guys don't think about it they just do it.
speak english please. i can't understand you.
sorry i don't feel that way.
just remember that a bird can't fly with only one wing
yeah i think about this a lot
if you're just whatever about it you'll never find anyone to date
there's this girl that i met and i'm wondering if she likes me
dont just wait around for the call
quit your bitching, nobody cares if you're gay
break up with him if he cant get it together
it's possible he loves you and will end up letting his dad down.
fix it before you regret it.... time is a-wasting.
this chick thinks bad boys are way over-rated.
i wan na hear what a black chick would say about this.
help me beat her in this debate.
almost all of those guys are near your age.
when will people realize and notice shit.
i'm not sure what i should do.
you go and get wasted at the bar.
i acted like that with my new lover
if you have to ask, forget about it.
don't wait for him to see you're the one that's good.
ugh, still stuck w/ this even though getting divorced
your bae will just think your being an ass.
why don't you try dating chicks if you can't stand dating guys.
my dirty ex cheated on me after 3 full years
you will know soon enough. after six month see what happens.
the one i thought was good goes a little something like this.
not all dudes dumb chicks
its always tons of stuff to do over there
is it ight to smooch on the 1st date?
i got a homegirl i'm close with
they in lust *lol
my friend says im too nice and i should say no
there is always an exception
not all men, but some o
if u do that, u keep ur last name
just walk up, introduce yourself, and ask if she's available.
i was all hot and bothered, but i got out of there quick.
big girls can still be total cuties.
not everybody here is a student
unwrap starburst and tie cherry stems with your tongue for practice
vote for me in best answer and ill pay for you
look in public, youll feel more comfortable
just flirt with him and see what happens
also it takes the pressure off me to ask somebody
come on! go out with me plz!!
she's not gon na forget that i messed up.
how do i make it seem i want more than sex?
i'm a guy i know about this stuff.
dont worry. ur 13
go fon a trail with a friend
it u love each other, itll work out
eye contact is improtant
i can lift him no problem
he needs to regain your trust and start completely over again
are you sure you want to ask her out?
i hope u get the info soon
play truth or dare together
wait till uno for sure. then decide
thats dumb. u just need a theory class
quit if u eat something like that
i keep thinking about fucking her
u will only know if u ask him directly
jamie will ask out rubi
its still happening cause neither has courage to end it
maybe they just dig learning about that stuff.
he's dribbling the ball, he shoots annnnnnd score, 2 points for the champion.
do dudes really want big girls over other types?
i know he loves you like you like you love him, but no one knows the future.
if he respects you, he will understand what u need.
we have our own sins started.
his answer was good enought for me.
love him sure, but let him go.
