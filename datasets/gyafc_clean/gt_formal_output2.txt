u have to be her friend.
that sounds more like a rhetorical question than a real one.
i'm not tryin to be mean....
women send men mixed messages sometimes
up fr coffee and chat then see what happens?
hate it when my dad is bummed out.
ask him if you should see a doc or sumthin'
give him a break, you're not the center of the dang universe.
i don't think he'll leave or cheat if u dont screw him
will i always feel like that???
but he may like all the coyness and yearning
and i wan na try again
some men shave because there women likes them to shave.
well if you really like this guy smile and talk to him with respect.
i'm not sure if he loves you but i do know for sure that he definitely likes you.
women are complicated because that is how men see us.
im overly selective with people. how do i stop
that sounds girly
the good may be better than the bad
only if u both agree
why do u like the boy who bullies u
men dont think they need u till ur gone
ehhhhh don ’ t be scared to tell a bro no!
is lov what i want??
they will thing u a creep if u leer at them
ur right. it is complicated
how do i get my love to show he lvoes md
yeah if you defo love them
doesnt matter if he us rich, dont sell yourself
you sound like a great guy, dont let these women get you down
idk but theres another site i go to
you need to think about how many arrogant women there are out there
well if your not dating then that seems kinda like a whore move
and so he was like, do you wan na use my chapstick?
you shouldn't ever ever ever let a man treat you wrong!
definitely not, he's huge and i'm really gd weak
go on and tell him if he says yes
what mistake did u take part in
king's got that joint'only ur mother luvs u'
aint no point in being beaud up if they gon na treat u bad
if u did it, what was it like?
girls that drink turn me on
if thats what u want
its like getting over addiction
i should try that next time i start dating
but what do you want?
it sounds like you both like things just as they are now.
don't let yourself be dominated, she'll just have to get used to it.
if he doesn't don't be upset as you can always catch another fish.
no guy can give you what you want.
if you wan na keep being married, find yourself.
start from scratch, then go from there.
ask em if they wan na go somewhere with you.
don't keep bringing it up, trust him
i still haven't tried that but i'm working on it
find the one that luvs you for you
come around my town and i'll be ur chick
don't touch this dude with a 10 foot pole
u don't hate one, that's fine, i dun like none of'em
i'd guess maybe around 3 or 4 or so
he's been telling that smack to other girls to, he's a man whore
really deep down i knew my previous girls weren't the one. then i met my wife.
no matter what, don't try to have them at the same time
sex isn't the only important thing.
i got yahoo mail it works.
fun for me includes eating you feel me lol
i mean he be busy after all that.
that would be just fucking!
don't walk up to that girl an tell her she sexy crazy.
it really sounds like you have a lot on your plate at this time.
i'm a guy, sou may want to ask another girl about those experiences.
i felt one way for a long time, but then my eyes really opened when i met the love of my life.
your best friend is always a backup plan if you can't find someone else to marry.
i dont just want to pop out and be like will you go out with me?
lest you know him really well, you ’ re setting yourself up for hurt!
if it ’ s your personal belief is not good or bad
those guys make you crazy bothering alllll day.
lol go to hawaii or pay a guy to do it lmao
i can throw em away n forget about it like yesterday ’ s garbage!!!
is it like that clear liquid thats yellow when it dries?
is weird when she drunk and sits on yo mans lap
it always had to be his way....
determination is a self given gift.
got ta wait 2years until you get hitched to a dude.
greetings and hugs to all my cone girlllzzzzzz!
just be yourself when you are together with her
idk what you are saying
the guy asked, do you mind if we cuddle?
why would some guys do that?
there are a few good girls out there, you have to look in the right places!
you got ta move on or work it out!
get yourself together, how can you love someone you don't want to talk to?!?!
find a pretty, talented girl!
um that doesn't mean you are slutty...
this is the only chance you have to enjoy true love.
you're gon na have to find it yourself.
they gon na get ova u in 2 months
you might not see color after some time but it dependz
i think he just wants to know if you're into him
if she's not into it anymore
no worries, u r def not slutty
there's no way of making a person feel something for you
definitely end it and keep your options open
had a pap smear before
yes im proud to have long black hair
i have a buddy in the same spot
maybe age is an issue
i'm not going to give you my nname but i've worked with this person for years
you'll tell him if you truely love him...
if your really attracted to her just follow your emotions!
think hard about if you can afford it and if you can go ahead!
um i say get your old life back so you can survive!
dude, what are you saying?
don't be flirty... its not a turn-on
some women would probably say it's painful
it'd be so much easier if i was pissed
just be done if they are
this is your punishment: 1mo no tv....
just say it, its not crazy because you ’ ve been to get her for so long!
doesn ’ t seem simple, tell me one more time slowly.
give em a chance to notice you!!!
unless its w/ wrong guy
my bf is obsessed w/ me and doesn't wan na lose me!!!
eh depends on whether they got brown hair
its just got ta play out after awhole
everyone wants to hear that they are sexy even if they won't admit it!!
i dance in downtown houston at clubs
i say good luck... but do ur homework!
i like natural more than a face with soooo much makeup on it
if you like him then you should def go for it!
we are divorced
who said women have no emotions
actions are louder than words
im thinking about a mdeium pink hue

dont ignore her, def listen and dont change the subject
hes my only $ $ $ til i graduate college
she; ll tell u if its not ok
im good either way i think

warm up to it, spend 5 minutes kissing and fondling you know that kind of thing
what's a unique gift to give my brother in law
be yourself man don't show off
if they dont then just live ur life
your first kiss should be memorable
this is the most beautiful thing in family
be genuine
i kno 3 guys i can do that wit
u can beat his ass if he keeps flirting w her
stick with the 13 or 14 year old boys
tell him he's being a dick and you just wan na be friends
cool, its like getting your dads approval
you have 2 wait for him to ask you out or youll look despereate
if he wont let up he just wants to bone you
i wan na have fun with you, that's why i answered this.
is that how you feel?
give him some cash and tell him to go.
he might call.
imagine what it'd be liek without them
i choose the domestic godess
are you deep in love with her?
men are always the first to get bored
get a good deal on flowers
either fix it or leave, make sure your happy
not everyone is decent boyfriend material just because you think they could be
do a citizens arrest on him
its not about the size of the pencil, its how your sign your name.
yes, this is great for all women
guys don't like secrets
well yeah, but it's up to the guy
people can't get why i'm hurrying
neither of em respect u
i totally can't talk to him even seeing him every week in psr
r u kidding, a dude who does that all da time is not for me!!!
give me a guy with nice smooth shaved legs anytime!; o
so you really on the down low or just going for a test drive
oh yeah, id say they do that for sure
now thats a reall f/up that ya can't take back!!!!
i had my cherry popped in a park when i was 16.
she says they never met but they love each other really.
ask that guy if he'll dance with you!
u should have faith and live a full life.
did you fall down? i don't know but i want to do it with you.
he knows you like him, just ask him out
dont be scared and tell him
im not gon na drive 5 hours to spend time with someone i dont like
do they gossip on the phone
play sports with ur guy friends
u feel happy and giddy when u fall in love
i cant live with my husband
we always push away those we like
if u both still think that way when you're older, do it
you're a man in the slightest sense
a and b cups are the best
if you're next to an ugly dude you'll look hot as a woman
yeah it's happened to me too and now i'm dating them
tell her wut you feel
you got naked baby pics
why do they want to marry
we did it on the hood in the rain
men don't need to grow up if women let em act like that.
do it a few times and you'll be cool.
while sex is like so fantastic!
i think hes pissed right now so he aint gon na be wit you.
fill me in if someone has the answer.
red is love, black your a goner and so on.
beefy peopel is what i like, feel ripped off with a skinny minni.
if your cluesless ask someone who would know.
when he tries to make up it will be fun
go with the one who likes you
ive been hard for her since freshman year
she was checkin you out, right?
i had no idea that life could be like this, so fantastic!
so, what's the best option for you and for him?
if nothing else, at least her phone number was the real deal.
it's all good, you aren't a slut!
they should get married if they can't control themselves.
she is on the phone with him all the time!
i don't see why, if you're already handing it.
i've seen you love a guy many times, but you just couldn't be sure if he felt the same.
is his mother a good enough reason to break up with him?
just be a nice dude and go for it, and if she doesn't really respond, then you know she's not feeling it.
my friends got hitched 6 months after their first date!
show her what you can do.
you look dumb.
this culture gets it right!
if ya'll don't ask you'll always wonder.
im saying dont worry so much... my 2 cents
whats the worst that could happen????
i hate 4 her 2 be that way. confused!!!! do know what to do....
look for a person who doesnt hate you
don ’ t be salty.....
some guys don't wan na dance.
this generation is retarded
well, could you trust him before?
ugly fat guys cant be picky
some poeple want to be a wife or husband
its not worth it if you only argue
enjoy asking that 2 ur cellmate in jail!
do i like u?
what'd you kiss
even i am curious about sex with another woman.
she ain't got ta be younger 20-32 is good.
that happens, your decision will be easier.
he cheated, which i think means i can lift or carry my husband.
make the best out of a bad set-up
u looking for dating or friends
id be good for valentines day
its very tempting: /
how long does it take for your relationship to get boring?
it just depends how fast you can get ready.
yeah i'd like to meet the girls.
it is what it is.
having online friends is cool as long as you set limits
do you want him to be your baby daddy?
he has low value if he turns you down girl
youll learn from experience, i promise
hope u married hubby coz of luv
i bet ima have someone waiting when i get home
u better go get that massage.lolz
ion know where 2 start
all depends how ur body looks, you like what u see when u look in the mirror?
are you telling me that u referring to you avatar?
he'll call you if he cares about you.
there's a huge different between banging and making love.
just cuz you have a kid, doesn't mean you got to stay together man.
are you from the city or country?
you can always get married and have kids later, but you can't do school later.
ive never gone to it
do you wan na have a relationship with the same guy?
how often can you have sex with pam andersen??????
make sure she doesn't end up hating your when you make your point to her
my mom has cancer too. too close to home!
running my fingers through curly hair, < 3 < 3 < 3 < 3
i mean u 2 both.
wait and the right gal will come, u will c...
i want my spouse to grow 2...
u need to make a move when there shy like that
the dr was just as surprised
its a yes, even if you don't agree
well boys do that but men dont
just try and say do you wan na go out at some point
i had this happen to me two separate times!
dont date a guy just bc you think you have to
listen if u really wanted him that bad you would not be asking me!!
i am hoping that it does not ever happen!
ladies just want guys 2 tell them how they really feel..,
u know how excited girls r when udoin it to them the right way
show her how much u want her!!
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss right on my forehead
yes im not 1 of those people--i know there's lots of them
ok it depends on how much you're starting to have feelings for this boy....
thank for the pep in advance
why do they want to be married?
i like gentle flirting with some romance
lets to an amusement park or museum.
i like the guy, but how do i know if i'm in love?
which do you prefer, manicured nails or fake 1s?
don't worry about what other ppl want, plan what you want
i don't get u
i like your perfume
most guys dont care, but it depends on teh individual
it doesnt have to do with u being naive
dont get married so soon
you are bad if u cheat on ur wife
just do you. if he likes what he sees he will speak to you.
that person is the only one you want to be with.
he's about to get hitched....don't even go there!
did you let her know how annoying checking in with you every single day is?
new neighbor asked me to chill
teenage boys and girls like masterbating
he is good at bbal
dont sweat
are you someone who likes to fight?
the most important issue is not trying to retaliate against the one who did you wrong.
one man who will go hours and miles to be with me.
omg, have you been to a doc yet?!
maybe she wasn't a biatch but the skinny girl was def!!
get a life and stop wasting my time!!!
its like the same thing as binging on chocolete then cryin about being fat
i went there and he was there
oh yeah if he's not taken then grab him
oh yeah if you dont do what they say you're gon na get a beating
well do you like him or not?
tell your mom and dad if you havnt already
most will tell you no
u think he feels the same way about u?
some guys only say love if they mean it...
he def likes u, show him how u feel!!
i think everyone should keep their own name.
guys enter and exit, but friends are forever
believe that it was considered love
you should be ready even if your relationship survives the four seasons.
some guys like chicks of that type and others, not so much
be a sham if u want kids
young dudes or old women, watch think?
he wants to keep the shit up
there is no alternative to just being ``love.''
your self-image is super important
i am a girl and i say that stuf...
girls can be just as perverted... trust me!!!!
flowers are nice but dont last long
i havent seen some movies
she is sweet. u should have her
use your brain not ur dick. maybe she doesnt like u
pleez dont take this the wrong way but that sounds like a girls name.
never call him back is not worth the problems.
not interisted in any ladies on my app list so i picked my neighbors sweet lady.
marraige is all trust and talking things out between each other
whatever they say to do, do not listen!
what can i do to snag her?
give her a ros44e and tell her you llove her.
it's not the norm, but it's not a bad thing either.
try working things out so you both end up happy
those girls could be enough for a man but their not up to our level
you got it, especially when she got sick.
i need more info b4 i can help u more.
there's no wrong or right way 2 kiss.
you should take ur time in deciding...
having some fun w/ ur guy friends is fine
i'd say its more of a trust issue...
i need help with this i'm screwed
if he dont like you then move right along
he doesnt want to know
if you can then make it yrself
is there anything else you do besides work and fix things?
i told her straight-up that i loved her
the senior guys think the freshman chicks are all easy, sad
how do i give him a kiss
look in the deleted items, that's where it should be
good luck finding that nice girl
that's a horrible idea, think of why you are there
that list could go on forever
be happy with anyone even if it's a man, just like brokeback mountain
don't base your whole relationship on sex
it's super bad luck if you sneak a peek at the bride on the wedding day.
stay strong out there, and i wish you the best!
it's just some lil get together for the fam.
if you're not really feeling the performance aspect, then skip it.
i just tied the knot
depends on how you were raised, how old you are, etc
no rush, you just got ta pick a last name when you have kids
don't you think your kid's gon na have a rough time being raised without their daddy?
bald men look like babies to me, it's just not cute
what was the score of the last game
get rid of ur ex cause u have a better man
fly or drive to vegas to get married
yes! i want to know u way better.
c or d is just what i like. doesn't need 2 be bigger than taht.
never admit the truth just change the lies!
they never played live before so it is twice as good.
momma won't let me wear those clothes.
we haven't seen you!
cause opposites attract and you'll always find some one
i def think that this is better than my life!
dont go to the same places that you went with your ex.
talk to your bestie and lem me know if it's cool
it sounds weird, but it def worked for me in 3-5 days
i dont like when he messes with you
no im not married
some men do like big girls, most tend to be african american.
overlook his faults and stay with him if you care.
do they make fun of you when with him?
if your against it that much- then do'nt get married.
it depends on if their vain or not.
get over it and get someone who actually likes you.
get to know her so you can ask her out soon.
i think he was blowing me off, so i asked.
i think some young guys like asian girls.
make your own decision.
just let him know you want something low key.
this is just plain bad, stuffed with lots of smaller bad things.
they've been pretty good years, but not the easiest
weve seen each other everyday for four or five years!!
pretend i'm the guy you want and date me!
hey a little flirting never hurt anyone!
you should go with your gut!
good luck.
why haven't i kissed a girl after eight months with her?
it's her choice.
they look better than lots of other nations.
the day after is alright by me.
see if she can go for movie and dinner
men get to the point. women dont
ask in english i dont get it
sorry, but i dont know...
remember, a bird has never flown with one wing
i often worry about this
youll never find a girlfriend if you are so needy
i met a girl recently, i want to know if i have a chance.
dont sit and wait for a call
be what and whot you want to be
if he gets it thru his head cool. if not move on
if he really loves u he'd disapoint his dad.
better do it before its too late
this girl does not want a shitty man.
i like hearing black woman talk baout this
hel pme argue with her
most of the men are similar to ur age
ugh, when will ppl figure this out?!
i dunno what i should do now
you go to a bar and get wasted!
i acted like that in front of my boyfriend.
if you got ta ask, it is a no.
don't just sit there and wait till he sees you for what you are.
im getting a divorce and i'm stuck with this!!
um your bf will think your being a jerk...
maybe give girls a try, since guys can be so off-putting.
i was with my ex for about 3 years before they were unfaithful.
just see what the next 6 months has in store, and you'll find out.
there is one in particular i was fond of, and it goes a little something like this.
not all guy break up with their girls
theres a lot of fun stuff there
is it alright to kiss on the first date
i have a girl friend
they wan na fuck each other
my friend thinks im too nice and should say no to them
but ( there's always a but )
some guys do, not all of them, though
if you do that you can keep your last name
go up say hey and ask if she's dtf
yo that was mad hot but kinda scared me off
fat girls can be hot
not everyone here is taking classes
practice taking the wrapper off of starbursts & tyeing cherry stems....with your tongue
if u vote for me for best answer, i'll pay!
go to a public place. you'll be more comfortable.
work with him and pay attention to how he reacts.
and inviting someone takes the pressure off me.
please say you'll date me.
she remembers my messes.
how can i let her know that i'm not just one more guy who'll hit on her and run?
i'm a guy so let me enlighten you.
it's gon na be ok, you're 13.
don't go trail riding by your damn self.
if you two love each other, it'll be good!!!!
got ta make eye contact.
yep i can lift him.
he's got ta start again and gain ur trust.
u wan na ask who out?
i'm hoping you read this really carefully
play truth or dare together!
wait till you find out and confirm, then go from there
um that is stupid bc you need a theory class for that!!!
just stop if you eat antying like that
can't stop thinking about sex with her
the only way to find out is to ask him face to face
woot jamie is asknig rubi out on a date!!
its carrying on because neither of you have the balls to end it
they seem to like learning about that
oh snap - he straight up just scored 2 points
do guys like fatter girls
he loves you too, but you got ta wait to know
if a guy respects u, he'll understand u.
we started this.....our own sins.
the dudes answer works for me.
youll be able to love him still, but get over it`
