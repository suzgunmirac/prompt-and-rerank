i do not think that not having sex with him will make him unfaithful toward you.
marriage is really about trust and communication.
ok, i have had this problem too.
what did you kiss?
could you trust him before?
do not make her hate you just to get your point across.
where have you been meeting these filipinas?
that way, you are not telling them what you specifically do not like about them.
if he is, then go ahead.
then, see if she is open for dinner and a movie.

however, every now and then, i find him looking at me.

ask her to go do something that she is interested in, or see a movie that she would like.
ha, ha. too bad it is not automatic, like msn or aol.
that is how they will respond, so yes. this is a bad situation for you and for him.
go back to that person at once before it is too late!
i, too, want to smack the smile off of her face!
ask him is he wants to dance with you.
she may think that looks unattractive. in my opinion, blue looks better.
ask him if you should go see a doctor.
i did not go out with him for a second date.
firstly, why was the relationship not terminated?
delay for what reason? proceed to accomplish your intent.

i believe i persist in feeling all-consuming romantic love for him.
i wished to never again have sexual activity.

i was cheated on for three of those years.
all seniors believe freshman girls are loose. it is sad, but true.
