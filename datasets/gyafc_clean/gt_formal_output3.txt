you have to actually be her friend, for real.
are u asking me a rhetorical question?
i didn't wan na be mean
chicks like to beat around the bush instead of just saying what they want
let's grab some coffee, talk, and go from there
when my dad is not happy, it tears me up.
just ask him if he thinks you should go to the doctor.
he probably just has other things on his mind to deal with than you.
i don't think he gon leave you or cheat cus y'all not doing it.
i feel like i'm gon always feel like that, am i gon always feel like that?
i mean he could like all the playing an anticipation an playing.
let me do it again.
some guys shave, but it depends on the woman...
if your really into this guy, just smile and be nice to him!
idk if he loves you, but he def likes you!
ah women are so complicated...
i'm too picky, i know, but i don't know how to stop!
sure sounds a bit fem.
if there's more good than bad, then it might be worth it.
only if the two of you agree on this.
y do u like the 1 boy who picks on u?
guys dont think they need u until your gone sometimes
you shouldn't be afraid of saying no if a guy asks you.
is love something i want?
dun keep looking at them like that, they'll think your'e leering or somethin'
yeah, i think you're right, that mess is confusing
how do i get my so to show his affection?
but only if you really care deeply about them.
just because he has money, don't let him buy you.
you're wonderful, so don't let these other women change how you feel.
idk about that, but i can tell you about another site i go to.
seriously, please think about just how many stuck up women are in the world.
if that aint your man then you would look loose.
he wanted to know if i'd want to use his chapstick.
you being mistreated by a dude is wrong
aint happening cause hes big and im a little thing.
if he says yes tell him
how did you screw up?
king's song: only your mother loves you.
why be with him if he's mean to you?
if you have, what was it like???
her getting too drunk isn't a turnoff
only if that is what you want!
it's like pulling out of a drug addiction.
damn, next time i date someone, i'm doing that
what do u want though?
ya'll seem ok with it, idk.
if u let her take over; she just got ta deal.
it's plenty of thirsty ass fish out there, so you'll be ight'!
its not possible for any man to give you every single thing you want.
find yourself if u wan na stay married to someone.
start off with a basic question you hear everyday, and move on from there.
ask if they wan na go on a date somewhere special with you.
dont bring it up again and just trust him.
i am nervous but trying to work up the courage to try it: )
find someone who loves you like you do them.
come see me to get me.
don't go near this guy.
i hate'em all but that's up to you.
probably 3 or 4.

sounds like you are going through a lot right now...
but you should ask a girl about the symptoms, bc i'm a guy
i always felt like then but then i met by true love and changed!
your bff could be a good person to marry if nothing else works out
i just wouldn't be able to walk up and say, how would you like to go out with me.
unless you know him like a brother, your really putting your neck in a noose.
it can't be good or bad if you feel that strongly about it.
they ’ re an annoyance alllllll day....
two options; go to hawaii or just pay some one.
i can drop him and never think about it again and act like he means nothing.
its a clear liquid that turns yellow when its dry

someone told me women have no feelings
words mean less than actions

if it's no, then you got ta move on.
it should feel like you're up with the angels when you have your first smooch.
of everything i've experienced during life with my family, this is the most lovely.
you just got ta be you, and that's essential.
that's something i can do with at least three guys i know.
can i kick his ass if hes flirting with her?
hang out qwith the 13 or 14 year olds

that's cool it's kind of like your dad is giving his blessing.
let him ask you out unless you are really that desperate.
if he insists, then it means he only wants so have sex.

red is love, black is death, etc. etc. etc.
i like thicker ppl - thin ppl make me feel cheated!
if you dunno ask someone who does!
after that comes the good part, when he tries to make it up to you.
the one that teases you is usually the one who really likes you.
okay, i've been into this one girl since i was a freshman in high school.
did you see her staring at you?
i didn't know life could be so great!
what works best for you both?
at least she gave you her digits.
i dont think your a slut
they can get married if they have no self control
she calls him a lot
i don't need to, you already are.
loved him a lot, not sure if he loves you too.
do i break up with him cause of his mom?
make a move, she's into you or nit.
i have some friends that only date for 6 months before getting hitched
show her your skills!
you'll look so silly!

if u dont ask, ill keep wondering
dont worry too much
what the worst thatll happen
i dont know what to do. i hate what she did

it is all about when you feel ready enough.
duhhh... i want to meet some women.
it's just how it is.
it's ok to be online friends but got ta have limits

try something like would you like to hangout sometime
it could happen to anyone even me twice
you shouldn't feel obligated to go out with him
well obviously you don't want to be with him otherwise you wouldn't be asking me that.
i hope this doesn't end.
women just want a man to be open about his feelings.
women like to be more into sex.
keep trying to impress her.
lean towards me and give me a soft peck right on the forehead.
i'm not like that, but there's a lot of them out there.
it depends on how much you are starting to get into this boy.
thanks for the pep in advance!
why would they want to get married?!?
approach softly and chase us!
let's go to an amusement park or a museum.
i like this person but dont know if im in love
do u like fake or manicured nails
plan what u want. dont worry about others
i dont get u
that perfume is dope
most men don't care i think, but it really depends on the person.
it has nothing to do with being weak, obedient, or naive.
don't get married too early in a relationship.
if you plan on cheating on your wife, you're not cool.
do the very best impression of yourself, and if he's down to clown he'll lip you up
you don't wan na be with anyone else but them
he's getting married, just stop
did you tell her that the day check-ins were annoying?
my neigbhor hit on me asap
most teen boys enjoy teen girls who like sex.
he played basketball well.
don't stress.
you must be a troll
fear, anger, revenge: these are the forces of the darkside
he loved me enough to close the long distant relationship from 1400 miles away to home
u been to a doc yet??
she's no shrew but that thin one was definitely!
dont waste my time... go do something!
its like eating too much chocolate and they bitchin that u got fat
i went there and he was there
go for it he single!
men like him will beat their wives if they don ’ t obey
do you think he ’ s hot or not??
if u haven ’ t yet, tell ur parents if you ’ re sure
sadly, you're going to get shut down by many people in your life.
do you think he's on the same page when it comes to the feels?
there's that four letter word that a man just can't say unless he really feels it.
he is totally digging you, so you got ta let him know.
i think everyone should keep their damn name.
friends are forever, guys sleep around tho.
think of it like love.
you got ta have your relationship ready for the four seasons.
some guys like some girls, not all types tho.
if you want kids be a stay at home mom.
what do u think of the young guy with the older woman?
he just keeps going
it'd have to be love there's no alternative
your self image is also important though
well i'm a girl and i say them things
girls can be just as preverted; )
flowers are nice, tho they don't last super long...
there are movies i still haven't seen
she is so sweet, def the person you are looking for!
hey, use your brain not your manhood - maybe she loves you!
ur name sounds like a chick's name, bruh... no diss, tho
meh, don't waste your time calling him back
no women i got the hots for around, i picked my neighbor's old lady instead!
not gon na have a good marriage without trust & communication, dude
don't listen to ppls advice, most of the time they wrong
what do you think i should do to get wit her?
maybe u should give a rose 2 show ur love 4 dem
it's weird but not bad weird.
find what's right for both of you, dude.
they're not kids but we're more mature by far.
yep, like when she puked.
need more info to help more...
kissing is kissing, theres no right or wrong to it.
think it over, don't rush the decision
it sok to have fun with guy friends
i think its more of a trust problem tbh
i need help figuring this out!
u better move on if that man don't want u
he aint interested either...
diy is the way 2 go
why do you always work and fix things?
i really meant it when i told her i loved her.
it just seems like all the male seniors think all freshmen girls are easy.
how do i just kiss him?
you should just check the deleted items, it might be there.
i think you'll find a nice chick to go out with eventually
bad idea, you're not there for that crap
the list is endless, tbh
brokebak mountain and stuff, but... you'll be ecstatic even if it is a dude
don't base your relationship on sex and you'll do fine
you are correct sir! never ever ever look at your future wife before the wedding ceremony begins.
keep calm, hold on, and you'll do great!
uhh it's just a small party for close family members...
don't do it if you aren't sure about the performance portion.
i just got married actually.
it depends on how old they are and how they were raised.
youll have to decide a last name once u have kids.
your kid is gunna have a really rough time with no fathe rin its life.
men that dont have hair are ugly to me, they look like a kid lol.
find out the score of the last game
if you love him you need to get rid of your x
best way to get hitched... cheap and quick in vegas!
i wan na know more about u
i like c or d size. nothing bigger
just lie and keep lying
i've never seen them perform so it extra awesome!
wife doesn't wear that mess
we don't know how you look!
opposites attract and every pot has its lid
i think its better than my personal life
dont go to the same places with her and you did with your ex
talk with your bro and see if its ok
thats odd.. it worked for me in 3-5 days
it pisses me off when he teases you about small shit.
no, i am not hitched yet.
there are a ton of guys into big girls, and most are black men.
stay with him if you care about him, and you shouldn't care what others think.
do they make fun of you when you and him are together?
don't get married if you feel this way.
depends on whether a person is full of themself...
ya got ta move on and find someone who doesn't hate ya...
you should be to know her and then one of you guys will ask the other out!
i asked him he was blowin me off...
maybe some younger sick guys like younger asian chicks.
make sure this is your choice.
tell him u want it casual
its difficult and lots of problems
the past few years have been ok, but not always easy peasy.
srsly, it's been 4, maybe 5 years, and there hasn't been a day we haven't seen each other.
just think of me as the man of your dreams, and be mine.
it never hurt anyone to let their flirt flag fly!
stick to what you kno in your gut.
good luck babes!
well... ive been with this one girl 8 months and not kissed her, is it bad?
got ta be the girls decision!
imo theyre better looking than other countries
it'd be fine the day after
just see if shes free for dinner and a movie
some men are inconsiderate assholes when it comes to women
can you speak english i have no idea what yr saying
i have never felt that, soz
got ta memba, no bird ever flown w/ 1 wing
i think bout this all the time
if u dont stop looking so down youll never find a significant other
i just met a chick and i wan na know if shes into it
keep busy while waiting for the phone to do its thing.
be yourself, don't change for anyone.
if he don't appreciate you, leave him.
he might really love you. or he's just doing it to hurt is dad.
do it before you run out of time
that girl doesn't need a man who is gon na betray her.
yo what a black girl say bout this
yo help me beat this chick at debate
they're pretty much dudes the same age as you, mostly
when are people ever going to understand?
really, what am i gon na do?
ya go to a bar and drink till your drunk!
i acted that way with my current bf
if you got ta ask... then no...
don't sit around waiting till he realizes how great you are
thought i divorced them but it still goes on....
she will just think you are an ass if you do that.
you should try to date girls since guys offend you
my ex of 3 years of being together cheated on me
eh, i say give it 6 months - time will tell!!
here is how the one i like went
not all gentlemen break up
its fun to go there. lots to do
can u kiss on first date
i have a close female friend
the want to sex each other
i am too nice according to my friends, and i should say no to him.
theres alway san exception right?
some guys do but not every single one.
if you do that then you will be able to keep your last name.
say hello and ask if she has a bf
that turned me on, but i left
fat girls can be hot
all tha ppl here are not here for school.
if u practice over & over u will be able to unwrap bothcherry stems and starbursts with ur tongue like me.
if you gim me your vote for best answer, i will pay the bill.
looking in public is prolly the best idea, plus you will feel safe there..
tease him see if he bites....
then i don't have to ask anyone direct.
say yes it'll be fun!
she never forgets when i screw up.
how do i approach her so she doesn't think i'm a guy with bad intentions??
as a guy... let me enlighten you
no prob, you ’ re just 13.
trail ride with a friend every time all the time.
if it ’ s meant to be they everything will work out.
eye contact, it ’ s what it ’ s all abouut.
he's a weakling, i can pick him up!
he will have to start over to get your trust back.
why would you wan na go out with her?
hopefully you'll review this thoroughly.
play t or d together.
got ta confirm it and go from there.
that's dumb u need a theory class 4 that.
quit if you eat something like that
i want some from that girl.
be blunt and confront him, that's how you will know
jamie's going to ask rubi out.
both of you need to have some guts and end this thing
could be interesting for them to learn about it...
he dribbles he shoots he scores!!! two points!
do guys really like big girls?
he def loves you too, but time will tell...
if he repsects you he'll get it
we're the source of our own sin
that response works for me
u can still like him. but move on
