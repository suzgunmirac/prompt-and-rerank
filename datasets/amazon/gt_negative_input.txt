if your bike had a kickstand on the plate it won t lock down . 
they are thinner and retain memory than the older ones . 
it makes a buzzing sound when devices are plugged in . 
i could barely get through it they taste so nasty . 
either than or the developers decided to do their own . 
the pair made in mexico is much better . 
i m selling mine to make room for something else . 
it looks like i ve splashed glitter all over my face . 
went to the second one using the same method ,  no go . 
it was not as good as our much cheaper model . 
so not that great for leaving on at night . 
when i contacted the company the response was that they shipped it . 
and ,  there were many things we liked about this game . 
ridiculous !  i had trouble getting it on with zero bubbles . 
i ve been through so many of these ineffective silly things . 
after a few days i noticed i was unusually fatigued . 
the jawbone may perform admirably as far as technology . 
did nt have time to return it before christmas so bought another necklass . 
another num_num calories from the other num_num grams of carbohydrates . 
these are supposedly cotton ,  but they don t feel like it . 
one major complaint is the micromanagment of collecting  shards  . 
i tried supergluing the magnets back on to no avail . 
no comment on the strainer since i have not used it yet . 
overall we will not be purchasing this product again . 
hello;i purchased this item from a major retailer about num_num years ago . 
i received the wrong color and it shreds easily . 
i will never buy hamilton beach products again . 
the description on the website did not state that the straps were elastic . 
we re too stupid to put together normal sounding sentences . 
the box is very shallow and not easily covered securely . 
this is not worth the money and the brand name is misleading . 
the cars that come with this garage are cute . 
spyro games always used to be fun ,  but that tradition ends here . 
the computer recognized the usb connection ,  but the cursor never moved . 
so i bought this product hoping it would help to regulate my cycles . 
i would not even give my current one away . 
we have been treating our hair for months and finally got this . 
i bought this set for our toaster oven . 
is that what you re looking for ?  go elsewhere . 
not that we should of had to do that . 
my mouth feels very dry and i am thirsty after drinking this . 
my cat just isn t at all interested in these springs . 
obviously we all have our own preferences for taste . 
since that time i have replaced the game . 
surely not worth what was paid for it by half . 
once you play one match ,  you ve played them all . 
i m just looking forward to the day i get to replace it . 
i like neutrogena products as a rule ,  so this was a disappointment . 
the original unreal tournament is the very definition of fun . 
the first time through ,  things really slowed down around level num_extend
two reviewers determined there are drivers to be downloaded but i was unsuccessful . 
the bar contains  agave nectar  which does not occur naturally . 
i couldn t stand the persistent smell of feces in my apartment . 
first ,  i put them both under my tongue simultaneously . 
not a good product for conditioning even though it says it has shea butter . 
i would never recommend this terrible waste of money case . 
i ve used it twice and it has stopped working . 
i run it outside the window and connect it to a garden hose . 
can t imagine how it acts when you heat style your hair . 
because it s too big for my cup holder . 
amazon was good to give me a refund right away . 
it crashed for no reason ,  saves got corrupted . 
i bought this toy for my boys a few years back . 
if you are sensitive to maltodextrin ,  this isn t for you . 
then contact sharp and go on from there . 
we ve tried num_num of these waffle makers since jan num_extend
i ll stick to my xbox for now ,  thanks . 
i ve used these a few times and broke them very easily . 
this one sits on our shelf collecting dust . 
two days later i no longer saw them anywhere on the building . 
i hate myself for falling for the james bond license and wasting $
don t buy this unless you like replacing toasters . 
this cream will give you acne if you have sensitive skin . 
i would not buy anything else from this vendor . 
i could feel some of the grains even after much shaking . 
and after all that ,  the base broke too . 
the aftertaste is so overpowering i had to brush my teeth . 
i am actually afraid to open the remaining jars . 
the charging light illuminates ,  but does not charge . 
the product is not durable but it might just be the one i received . 
then she said  well you ordered the pu which is what you got . 
i didn t have the rust problems that others had . 
in that short time ,  he ripped one wing off the toy . 
this item does not provide full coverage as the picture suggests . 
these definitely open up your nasal passages and functionally work as advertised . 
this is a fantastic idea ,  however it has some flaws . 
if you can afford it step up to something that will last . 
i won t be buying from this vender ever again . 
i thought the concept was good; scuffy thinks otherwise . 
every product i own from them has failed or been a letdown . 
i would not trust anything bigger than iphone num_extend
i have a  made in usa  version of this . 
then i put the cream on my feet especially around my toes and heels . 
you can go to any chain store and do better . 
i simply treated it how i would assume a curling iron works . 
also the  free will  option is an absolute joke . 
if you are stir frying your ingredients  i . e . 
of course in most sports games ,  graphics shouldn t matter . 
i had it professionally installed at a local bike shop . 
this ring looked beautiful on out of the box . 
i did some research ,  and went with this one . 
i figured this would be a great alternative to use during the six weeks . 
i bought this for my num_num month old from santa for christmas . 
we purchased this so our daughter could have fun toy to play with . 
please reply with the filter part number and your location . 
i woke up with basically an oil slick on my face . 
i put it together to surprise my husband . 
it hasn t done anything for his thin coat though . 
they send you num_num because each one lasts about two days . 
i felt i must have missed something if the reviews were so good . 
i have to lower the rating another notch . 
i have purchased fairly cheap holders from motorola and they lasted a while . 
i was surprised as the box seemed to be in good shape . 
i was looking forward to this game for a couple of num_extend
these run quite small even though they are stretchy . 
i think i will return and stick with wool gloves . 
like showdown : legends of wrestling , it has too many glitches to count . 
if you have soft facial fair then by all means use these razors . 
she handed it back to me and picked up her ginsu knife . 
got all excited ,  but this taste nohthing like honey at all . 
it scrolls way too easily and way too smoothly . 
a little at first ,  more with each successive try . 
i had to get some from the phone store . 
you can probably run them over with your car and still be okay . 
the wheel oftenly stuck and wont turn on its rail . 
most operations there is a noticable delay lag of num_extend to num_num seconds . 
there was nothing at all to indicate that belkin manufactured this item . 
my little girl wanted this for her birthday ,  so we got it . 
this meter is technology from a decade ago . 
i do not like this belt because of lack of material . 
too small and not the quality i expected . 
it just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air . 
i purchased this based on rave reviews from others . 
i guess maybe there are some people that this product could help . 
with sliced cheese in lieu of french bread on a fruit and cheese plate . 
it didn t have the smell a lot complained of though . 
i have been using it twice a day since i received it . 
i put in a password but router won t recoginize it . 
worse ,  the controls are so confusing that it gives me a headache . 
now i have a game that i don t ever want to play . 
nokia knows how to design a very good interface . 
basically ,  this product is a ripoff on consumers . 
this is honestly the only case i ve thrown away in the garbage . 
i ve had many lighters and this one might be the best . 
its good that its made in canada rather than china . 
this machine is no match for the new consoles . 
i contacted the company and they said that the shipment had been lost . 
it s the lame players that drives halo multiplay into the ground . 
good for one day only . and opi test this product on animals . 
first of all ,  syrup shouldn t run ,  it should ooze . 
also it gets very hot while plugged in ,  which freaked me out . 
returned product but from what i ve heard it does the job . 
drinking the coffee was slightly less unpleasent than the smell suggested it would be . 
it is worse then no lube because it gets soooo sticky . 
birds or squirrels . tried num_num different kinds of bird food . 
however ,  definitely does not work like a new battery . 
what a ripoff !  learn from my mistake ,  do not buy . 
and still the focus was extremely soft or just plain terrible . 
i also tried a cheaper brand of slip on rubber broad heads . 
other brands in this large of a container are glass . 
yes ,  they are light ,  and are not durable at all . 
she could have decorated her carrying case herself . 
there are companies that make dog biscuits with the activated charcoal in it . 
i ve learned that companies make varying degrees of quality . 
thought ,  hey why not try something different might work . 
audio isn t a religion and these are not holy water . 
the real thing is nong shim shin noodle ramyun . 
this just doesn t have enough power to massage my shoulders and neck . 
with a couple of bucks you could make something a lot better yourself . 
i had much better luck with the other three pairs mentioned . 
it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends . 
 the bowl is too light  we even had it on a rubber mat . 
will break in over time though ,  it s rubber . 
it is so small . get a racket ball . pass this one by . 
that is not to say that these treats are bad by any means . 
the buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking . 
i m sure it depends on your age and body type . 
the transmit strength on this compact num_extend is pretty strong . 
generally if a toy makes noise ,  i don t mind so much . 
there was almost nothing i liked about this product . 
i used the product for five days straight before running out . 
so i guess it s really a matter of preference . 
first of all ,  this will void whatever warranty you have with microsoft . 
and it is very possible that these are good cables . 
the bottom part is stretching after only a month of owning the case . 
but it didn t do anything for my face . 
i got this for my num_num month old daughter for christmas . 
they pee in it about once a week ,  if that . 
i only ordered on here because they were alot cheaper . 
insert the micro usb to your phone and enjoy your widescreen display . 
to ataris credit ,  this game was a bit fun . 
i say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too . 
trying to slide to a different screen instantly turns it back off . 
it not educational or exciting and it s annoying . 
i spent $ for the num_extend and overall it was not worth the cost . 
im thinking num_num gem stones in at least a num_num inch wheel . 
i can use a creamy concealer on it . 
shame on what otherwise has been a reliable company with several other respectful products . 
my husband said it was obvious so i had to return it . 
speedloader is very hard to use especially with an extended magazine . 
mind you the oem xoom charger is not like that at all . 
for the price tag ,  its nothing to rave about . 
i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces . 
i had to buy one out on the road . 
this particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department . 
i m tired of cheaply made ,  high priced appliances . 
i won t give this to the new puppy i m getting . 
i bought this skillet for steaks and fried potatoes  , and fried eggs . 
note that i got mine from an amazon store called  small appliance  . 
i practically felt like i threw away my money on this one . 
maybe it just needs broken in and some fine fitting . 
after four days of that ,  i gave up and chucked it . 
in num_num thq came out with this wrestling game . 
i didn t have enough of them to return . 
i cannot recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission . 
for me this was a most disappointing product . 
this is just a little too low quality . 
the lid is the best part of the pot ensemble . 
this is due to the short lived cheaper lasers they put in them . 
whatever the case ,  i couldn t be more unhappy with this purchase . 
these make great little night lights for the kids . 
i ve not had this happen with my wusthofs . 
first ,  there is nothing about this to really write home about . 
the item was considerably different quality than pictured . 
$ is too much to pay for a $ cable . 
hopefully you won t have to go through this nonsense . 
i agree with the others that this was tough to open . 
i must find a way to return them . 
does increase volume but does not feel nice to the touch . 
i don t see what others have liked about this . 
i have no idea why this is a cult favorite . 
it makes an annoying sound when it is on . 
me too is a nice brand and make very comfortable shoes . 
with this i say i work giving support to the u . s . 
first things first ,  make sure you are ordering the right headset . 
this game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about . 
another  energy  product that simply wastes our money . 
very well designed and easy to figure out . 
this game gives you no incentive to keep playing . 
i thought this was the hard plastic screen cover and it isn t . 
would suggest using one of the toy bubblers amazon sells . 
plus ,  it s not very filling ,  even for rice . 
i ve used it once and i won t be using it again . 
the cables seem rather basic and work well ,  except one problem . 
this cord seemed like a deal and got good reviews . 
that does not hold true for this product . 
i had high hopes for this product since i bruise easily . 
this is called cheating !  i expected canister with fuel at least . 
the inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all . 
it opens cans ok ,  but no better than the old fashioned openers . 
i d rather be a little less healthy and a little more happy . 
try explaining to a two year old why her tattoo keeps  breaking  . 
the kids thought it was great ,  but it got old pretty quick . 
this did not stop odor and my pets wanted to eat it . 
marineland does a very good job with their led aquarium systems . 
once the charger is removed ,  the phone starts working ,  again . 
and theres no warning on any of these cans that i can identify . 
like they glued it together and shipped it out it seemed . 
i did not purchase my set from this vendor . 
they are cheerios ,  afterall ,  and we love the original kind . 
it makes a farce out of a good num_num num_extend
it could be that i live in an apartment with hills and trees around . 
i miss my days of cracker eating before becoming gluten free . 
both rub my dog raw and cause bleeding . 
do not buy . i didn t expect much because of the cost . 
i did not buy from a num_extend party seller . 
while the mascara is soft ,  it is not full . 
i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week . 
also ,  it creates more static than the one i m used to . 
overall it is inconvenient to keep the counter and the unit clean . 
it s this second part that really grosses me out . 
because these knives will greatly appreciate on the collector s market . 
gave it to someone named happy on her birthday . 
just spend the extra bucks and buy an official one from apple . 
absolutely horrid; cheaper @ costco if you must . 
it took three years three vets and over twelve hundred dollars spent before success . 
my first draft of this review was also way too long . 
all the songs build on the same words . 
hasn t had to be rebooted yet due to connection issues . 
i kept it though i do not use it . 
the concept was great and it worked very well when it worked . 
the did not a aborb water at all . 
i adjusted the volumes on the ipod and the cassette player . 
i was not at all pleased with the performance of this chopper . 
i have no padding of my own to offset hard soles . 
and i wanted them all to be easy to access . 
this is a good hoodie and well made . 
it s very black ,  and it does add volume . 
cheap ,  low quality chicom scope with even cheaper ring mounts . 
first of all i m not some raging halo . 
i started using xlear nasal spray a few years ago . 
first ,  and surprising was that they have removeable sole inserts . 
however ,  i feel civilization iv is most definitely not an improvement overall . 
avoid the heartache and wasted titme of bad discs . 
but this stuff will fall apart after only a few washings . 
company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this . 
lasted for two games ,  during which i was the sole operator . 
very hard plastic and not that fun to play with at all . 
save yourself some time and money and skip this product . 
a process that takes a couple of minutes . 
i love cheetos and any artificially or naturally enhanced cheese snack . 
hardly something i would give as a wrapped birthday gift . 
the problem with the acrylic ones i ve found is the tipping factor . 
bought this for use to hold my droid incredible . 
that is right up until one day the record feature stopped working . 
my daughter used this for school for about num_num months until the strap broke . 
i have num_num bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard . 
spent more time fiddling with this than i did looking at the road . 
don t waste your time or money on these jeans . 
i first used it on my hands and fingers . 
i also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around . 
not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush . 
i threw it out because i can t take alcohol . 
after that you have to pay a subscription . 
there s no way this will last as long as claimed . 
i will still continue to use philosophy products ,  just not this one . 
certainly one of the more widely produced in the us . 
just reinstall the previous ghost recon and raven shield games . 
all of them are utter garbage ,  not even decent polyester . 
i d suggest anyone looking to purchase linksys products look into netgear instead . 
good thing filters for num_num gallon tanks are cheap . 
i might return it ,  but i need a can opener . 
instead i would recommend cetaphil gentle cleanser and you will be fine . 
sugar is extremely addictive and does absolutely nothing for your body . 
i d rather tie a towel around my neck as a cape . 
the constriction on my dog caused him to sit . 
the case fit okay but not attractive at all . 
as i get hit ,  my health endurance goes down . 
they would flip off or get hung up due to poorly rolling wheels . 
one thing is the amazingly poor unit a . i . 
i expected an improvement in signal strength from my tiny usb direct plugin type . 
my first suggestion to anyone reading reviews on this product is to keep looking . 
for some reason it worked out terribly for me . 
amazon does not provide enough information about this press . 
multiplayer is just as bad ,  though thankfully not worse . 
i was bored after the first num_num minutes . 
i loved the food for my cats as you can read below . 
th product features and editorial review spell germany as the origin of manufacture . 
it didn t work for me hopefully other people will have better luck . 
flavor :  it has some tangy notes ,  and overall not bad . 
mine is a piece of junk ,  as far as i am concerned . 
would have been alot nicer if it simply threaded in with the correct alignment . 
it is best to invest in a good set of makeup brushes . 
i am only giving this item num_num stars because of the absurd price . 
this does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself . 
it almost fit ,  but not enough to snap completely together and fit . 
there is no menu selection for find free books . 
i will always have slight pain ,  no matter what . 
the material that it is made of is like a dirt magnet . 
it works for maybe a few minutes and wears off quickly . 
the directions were easy to follow but the quality of the easel was pathetic . 
waste of money ,  waste of time ,  waste of blood . 
this case is far from what i expected . 
too bulky and there are better products out there in single units . 
does not give me any confidence in buying any of the discovery kids toys . 
i would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water . 
old grandson loves all things that have to do with construction . 
maybe a num_extend old girl could wear it . 
so please stop buying this and maybe they will lower the price . 
soe decided to push it to live a whole num_num weeks sooner than that . 
it s not overpowering ,  it is not like perfume . 
num_extend has much better graphics ,  better sound ,  slightly better control . 
also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head . 
claritin used to be the best thing around . 
it really is like they didn t take anything at all . 
i tried everything short of breaking the thing open . 
other reviews seemed more positive ,  but i just gave mine away . 
i dumped all num_num screen protectors in the trash bin . 
does this ever happen to the cpu ?  rarely . 
i would not buy this again in the future . 
crayola makes the best crayons ,  don t get me wrong . 
perhaps it won t rust ,  but upclose it looks a little cheesey . 
so i just thought maybe it ll help keep my acne away . 
its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones . 
my dog has started to become anxious at bedtime . 
so after two months of use ,  working in it . 
i don t know why it has all the good reviews . 
there were other vegetables included ,  but you really couldn t taste them . 
the quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less . 
i used this along with another similar product ,  for over num_num months . 
i don t think the saying  you get what you pay  . 
if you want a cheaper sub deal with companies that specialize in that category . 
enfamil infant is characterized by choline and dha . 
you dont get so much sand with this . 
if you get these just be a bit careful . 
it reminds me more of silly putty than of a concealer . 
it worked for maybe num_num months then died . 
this is not at all expected from a respected brand like sony . 
my goof to not research this brand more . 
i found these patches very hard to put on . 
i ve not been terribly impressed with this box . 
i will add an update if i ever figure it out . 
i tried hiding them in her food and in her treats . 
she didn t like the handle of this one at all . 
well it made it worse like a rubber band texture . 
i ll just stick with a good mayo and skip the bacon . 
thank heaven the operation is intuitive because there are no instructions . 
i thought i was over charged once it was returned . 
i bought them and find them pretty annoying . 
after all the great reviews i thought i d give this a try . 
unfortunately this product did not do much for me . 
you get what you pay for i guess . 
it might work for all purpose flour ,  which has less gluten . 
in my experience ,  they are a constant source of problems . 
disappointed as i expected to received candy that would last a long time . 
the waist cords are over a foot long after being taken in . 
so ,  this car looks cool and all but its not that great . 
i have no idea if it s me or this product doing . 
otherwise ,  they fall off your head at the slightest lean or tilt . 
just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake . 
try it once and you won t think it s stupid . 
it was supposed to be a complete toy . 
nevertheless ,  the smell lasts for num_num or num_num minutes tops . 
good that they are from usa and not china !  . 
so far i am not at all happy . 
i purchased them and when they arrived they were torn . 
quite tasteless and they make you order so many . 
camera fell of it after a few uses . 
i will never again purchase another game where this is a requirement . 
really ,  it all does look nice graphically wise . 
its very similar to that type of style . 
might have been nice ,  but just went over my cheeks . 
the shape of the grains makes all the difference . 
first ,  without the extension they are very short . 
i then emptied th coffee grinder and looked for an obstruction ,  none . 
they have a medium pile lining that has more of a stiffer polyester feel . 
nightwolf s friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers . 
it s too bad because they look like they would keep my ears warm . 
these salmons are in water not vegetable oil . 
when you place the eye brow attachment on you can get a mixed cut . 
i won t be buying any more in the future . 
i hated the color that was sent to me ,  pale chalky beige . 
that s not what it felt like with the original gel adhesive . 
the radtach procable num_num inch dock extender works only part way . 
because it is definitely not worth full price . 
i would not recommend this item for dogs who chew . 
this is the worst game i have come across in a long time . 
unfortunately i m not sure what all the five star reviews are for . 
it is too bad because the ingredients looked to be quality . 
i wore this product today for a few hours today . 
the feel of the wheel is nice and i like the side scrolling feature . 
a definite num_extend for how they handled this . 
am very disappointed that i still can t wear my shoes !  . 
it didn t fit in my bathtub ,  which is a standard size . 
we plugged in an extra headset laying around the house . 
this case looks nice but that s about it . 
it takes several passes through some types of hair to cut it . 
i contacted q cell and they replaced the back cover . 
i hope it will be a better choice . 
i love that it uses natural ingredients but it was ineffective on my skin . 
after a num_extend try i received the same product . 
most products are for dandruff caused by dry scalp . 
over and over  and over and over  again . 
this product was not in functioning condition when delivered . 
this is a worthless item that makes no sense at all . 
worked best on older new england house with narrow staircase . 
might work for others ,  didn t work for me . 
not to mention it did not fit my screen completely . 
i thought that all of the possibilities would be awesome . 
it was all potatoes and had very little clam flavor . 
taking it out of the box i found the design to be awkward . 
i purchased this jawbone hd as a replacement for an older jawbone thinker . 
i reported it havent heard a word about it . 
i was hoping for a bit better than this from amazon . 
this case is cute however the is the only good thing about it . 
i ve come to the conclusion that i ve wasted my money . 
i would not recomend this for a tmobile ,  mytouch phone to anyone . 
the good pieces that i manages to salvage the birds refuse to touch . 
he enjoys this toy ,  but can get the treats out fairly quickly . 
like how many times you face the nazgul and how easily they are beaten . 
i ordered num_num and find this to be a hugh mistake . 
if you are grinding dry items ,  it should be ok . 
the entire thing fits in the palm of my child s hand . 
i ordered these from amazon since i could find them nowhere in my area . 
so what it comes down to is that u get what u paid for . 
the balm is crap more like a vaseline stick . 
i guess it fails in the truth department on its advertising . 
in this case ,  it s a big disappointment for num_extend
i bought this product for feeding my num_num persian cats while on vacation . 
it is a poor performer when it comes to odor retention and clumping . 
do not buy this product ! the photos are horribly ,  horribly misleading . 
it adds size o an already pretty big system . 
armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like homeworld or even starcraft . 
they were huge ,  yet the same size in the leather is tight . 
they also make noise if you happen to touch one against the other . 
it worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely . 
spend the extra bucks and get the chopat knee bands . 
unfortunately ,  not my blackberry nor my cell phone . 
i contacted the seller and was given a refund . 
the graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version . 
it was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system . 
it does this to a very significant degree and is extremely uncomfortable to wear . 
there must be an engineering issue with the motor of the toy . 
the quality is declined quickly by heat exposure . 
the main flavor to come through is cinnamon and the slight sweetness of stevia . 
i was also very disappointed at how quickly it drains the batteries . 
i can not send it back due to shipping requirements . 
as the clock clicked by num_extend i still felt sluggish . 
ekobrew ,  the coffee always stays in that bottom wedge section . 
i can t send it back again because i don t have it .
