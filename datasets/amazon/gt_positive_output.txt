i ve had this thermometer for just num_num years
will update this review should it break like my previous wheel .
this product does not do what it is supposed to do .
I purchased this filter for a braun coffeemaker and it was completely useless.
bad price for it
so , to me this is almost instant
replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this piece of junk.
i use this somehow as a small office supply shelf
not very durable and seems similar quality to apple products
i have a few oxo products and have always been disappointed.
the blade weight and thickness of the wustof was definitely better
make sure the pins don't line up with the contacts .
it turned out to not replace what i had lost .
i dislike the way these roll instead of sliding on the rod.
wrapped poorly
they don't pile up nice in the closet and never clean up great in the dishwasher .
i had it a long time now and i still find it useful
this offers terrible protection for the phone.
this is one of the worst vacuums ive ever come across
one hour per slice seems like a awful pace so far.
i would have given this five stars except for the few complaints i had
the metal is very breakable and the non stick finish is bad.
the flap also is not good and comes loose often.
dull cutting edges make your pies look bad .
i m a male , a bachelor who still lives alone
I had to recently throw it in the trash as the line wore out quickly.
I have several of these, it's not worth it.
i would not recommend this to anyone who wants a pda.
i believe it was expensive when it came to market .
bad charger, too expensive
the whole thing gets unbearably hot when you use it .
so shipping takes a while but it is definitely not worth the price.
not blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets , and glassware.
the sound range and loudness is terrible for the price and size.
doesn't work for about anything you want to shred , cut or mix .
if you order it by itself, shipping is terribly expensive.
i know pie weights are not for me.
the head set is not very comfortable at least for me
washing is a pain and takes several hours.
once glitch , which i did not view as all that positive .
i have had this mount for about a year and it works okay .
this happened after only a couple of days of use.
but it's not good for wireless , i've never had worse .
not a good choice for me
shipping was expensive directly from realook and arrived two weeks later.
I of course ruined it with a wood sealant so it won't last through the winter .
it is isn't very easy to use and i have had some problems with it.
i don't think that is the way to keep the fish moist
it was just one that frankly that's a big deal.
i have had lots of problems with the teflon flaking off.
The vacuum head is way too small.
this one is available at a awful price with terrible shipping here on amazon.
i hated almost everything even the cucumber juice echhh .

after several days, the contents of the wine bottle weren't air tight.
i bought this in num_num and the pan is already in horrible shape .
I have never found a use for these.
too small
both english and metric measurements are present onto each spoon
and it will not keep your rice hot or edible for any amount of time.
the copper finish is coated with a not nice to see plastic to prevent oxidation
doesn't keep the air nice
belt works well enough and installed in a few minutes
the margin of safety is very bad from overflow
i paid too much $ for this when I bought a  few other pieces.
I wouldn't buy this again even with one-day shipping.
so far has not lasted for a long time and wears off.
they were horrible and they don't work i hate them a lot .
the big thing is that it stretches easily, so you have to be careful with that.
this can't compete with any knife you can buy .
dash mounts are either very bulky and in the way or not nearly strong enough
i paid over num_num cents plus shipping for this protective cover case.
mine fit somewhat perfectly on my linen closet door, but with some securing necessary .
Not sturdy with a bad selection of teeth sizes.
i never use it a lot, it always gives me problems.
It's more powerful, so I expect it to be too loud.
the handle is comfortable enough and holds the pitchers in your hands
that said , the mic did not pic up everything it could .
i regret that i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer.
there are way too many bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight .
I get oil all over my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel.
it does not work great and i am extremely unhappy with it.
the shipping charges are now higher and missing on the order .
i bought it only for a new iphone num_extend

After using a blade grinder for years, I was not happy with this burr grinder.

the charger is so far  working with my wireless bluetooth speaker
although once you go a little past halfway the quality gets a remarkably worse .
i m starting to loathe it immensely because i don t need to upgrade .
i guess you could say so what it s a stupid ladle .
slow; worse than a blender and is tough to use .
overall i hate them , and would never buy them again .
i have them in different locations in my house
the voice from the earpiece doesn't work .
they came with no instructions to be found and not much more to say
went looking for them and couldn't find them .
upset at purchase from the start
the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess all the time .
i am happy that i did not spend a full fortune on the electric models
it s very difficult and takes up a lot of space on the pot rack .

on the other hand for power grating it does not work.
unfortunately , the remaining sticker is attached to the second film .
don't use it anymore
the cheese never came out light and fluffy .

They don't work as well as expected.
i say that after trying many cheap pathetic headsets that I loathe , sigh .

the la prima ran about half a shot then broke the machine.
with low usage its closer to only 1 hour .
there are no lights to indicate the unit's charge level.
The bottom most container is smaller than you'd think.
that s what it does and it does it not bad
do not recommend this at all
however, this is an example of how rosie got it wrong.
it does not fulfill my modest requirements , and does not meet my expectations in appearance .
some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee , they were correct .
i hated installing two of these for the front entrance of our house .
look up videos on swype if you want to see it doing badly
i like that is is somehow durable and washable
the aluminum ones get unpleasantly stained and ugly after a few uses .
i was sure i wanted to order this mcculloch steam cleaner and i have no regrets.
adds a huge amount of bulk to your phone
place it in the freezer and try to close the door
open carefully and handle the zippers with care because they break .
it had a good cost and a nice product

only bad things to say about this horrible innovation
it gets dirty easily and gets stained.

i wore my first one out by using it normally.
also, do not ever use that yellow cloth to clean your phone.

sometimes i m there for an endless number of hours .
no warranty, bad deal
The cover doesn't do what it is supposedly designed to do.

i bought this as a gift for my brother and he hated it.
: pi also have very limited space in my kitchen .
it would have been smart if it had a crank or something to make it easier
maintenance cleaning is slow, neglected cleaning takes way more time and repeated cleanings.
i also hate it because the jar is plastic .
as stated by the many reviews , this is a discreet carpet cleaner
not bad over fruit and kashii go lean crunch cereal
you've probably seen these products too often on iron chef.
I think that dsp manager is the stock one for android phones and it doesn't work well.

I can't hear the caller clearly , vice versa .
the big issue is the blue light is very annoying

don't like the braun
i would definitely not recommend this for a cute case .
but the back side looks terrible as well.
I bought three of these units and can't place them in our home.
And this is not what you would need.
it works fine and the coffee is not bad !
it does not pick up what is directly in front of it.
pretty much almost all i ask for in a grinder
it's a mediocre quality at an inflated price.
just do your homework and you will end up pretty dismayed .
this knife sharpener did not come close to meeting our expectations.
most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much unpleasantly smaller .
not a perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works .
i have tried a lot of them and this was disappointing.

plus it is amazon and they will put there name on any piece of junk
not that stable
another thing i like is that it does not have rivets
didn't read any reviews
somehow fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x
money wasted i think
it stores in a really small place and is built to break .
didn't save on cleaning or the use of aluminum foil.
what a bad change in my life this will make .
the sound is also surprising for the price and is somehow enough for me
this is the second one of these that i have had to purchase.
it requires some genius to get this unit operating
too many trips to refill
carrots leave an unsightly orange smear on the surface.
the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were clear enough
Once the lid closes the smell still comes out.
it has a more bulky feel as the other cases available .
this is a terrible learning experience and so far has been awful
not what I thought
I have realistic expectations of this device that were not met.
my wife despises window fans and she hates this thing too.

i dislike that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill.
we have begrudgingly used ours at least a couple of hundred times .
You don't need this with one of the older foodsavers.
i would never even give some as gifts this holiday season .
the finer the setting, it takes much longer.
I use these reviews so heavily that I don't want to give back.
why doesn't it have a wider design for different foods .
its actually a little worse than the filter that came with the unit .
doesn't charge much
i ve had to repair it too many times to count as it s % plastic .
this is the worst cookware i've ever owned.
everything seems to stick and it is something you need to worry about
